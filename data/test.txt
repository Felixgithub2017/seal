Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies based on nonhierarchical free associations .
Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable , unnecessary , or harmful .
While antistatism is central , some argue that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations , including , but not limited to , the state system .
As a subtle and antidogmatic philosophy , anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy .
Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy .
There are many types and traditions of anarchism , not all of which are mutually exclusive .
Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism .
Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications .
Anarchism is often considered a radical leftwing ideology , and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism , or participatory economics .
Anarchism as a mass social movement has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity .
The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by anarchocommunism and anarchosyndicalism , with individualist anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon which nevertheless did have an impact on the bigger currents and individualists have also participated in large anarchist organizations .
Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression , supporting selfdefense or nonviolence , while others have supported the use of some coercive measures , including violent revolution and propaganda of the deed , on the path to an anarchist society .
The term is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism , themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i . e . anarchy narxosἄναρχοςref . from the privative prefix ἀν , archos , i . e .
'leader' , ruler' ; and the suffix or .
The first known use of this word was in 1539 .
'Anarchistswas the term adopted by Maximilien de Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of , though among theseanarchiststhere were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists .
There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation , such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling , but they did not use the wordanarchistoranarchismin describing themselves or their beliefs .
PierreJoseph Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist , making the formal birth of anarchism the midnineteenth century .
Since the 1890s from France , the termlibertarianismhas often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States ; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States .
On the other hand , some uselibertarianismto refer to individualistic freemarket philosophy only , referring to freemarket anarchism aslibertarian anarchism' .
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC , among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi , and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan .
Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist .
Zhuangzi wrote , A petty thief is put in jail .
A great becomes a ruler of a Nation . '
Diogenes of Sinope and the Cynics , their contemporary Zeno of Citium , the founder of Stoicism , also introduced similar topics .
Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the Christian anarchist tradition .
Georges Lechartier wrote thatThe true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ andnbsp ; . . . the first anarchist society was that of the apostles . '
Such a distinction reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other antiauthoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible .
This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry .
The French renaissance political philosopher Étienne de La Boétie has been said to write an important anarchist precedent in his most famous work the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude .
The radical Protestant Christian Gerrard Winstanley and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England .
The termanarchistfirst entered the English language in 1642 , during the English Civil War , as a term of abuse , used by Royalists against their Roundhead opponents .
By the time of the French Revolution some , such as the Enragés , began to use the term positively , in opposition to Jacobin centralisation of power , seeingrevolutionary governmentas oxymoronic .
By the turn of the 19th century , the English wordanarchismhad lost its initial negative connotation .
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment , particularly JeanJacques Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
There were a variety of anarchist currents during the French Revolution , with some revolutionaries using the term anarchiste in a positive light as early as September 1793 .
The enragés opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms .
Denouncing the Jacobin dictatorship , Jean Varlet wrote in 1794 thatgovernment and revolution are incompatible , unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself . '
During the French Revolution , Sylvain Maréchal , in his Manifesto of the Equals , demandedthe communal enjoyment of the fruits of the earthand looked forward to the disappearance ofthe revolting distinction of rich and poor , of great and small , of masters and valets , of governors and governed . '
From this climate William Godwin developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought .
Godwin was , according to Peter Kropotkin , the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work' , while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early Edmund Burke .
Benjamin Tucker instead credits Josiah Warren , an American who promoted stateless and voluntary communities where all goods and services were private , with beingthe first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism . '
The first to describe himself as an anarchist was PierreJoseph Proudhon , a French philosopher and politician , which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory .
The anarchocommunist Joseph Déjacque was the first person to describe himself aslibertarian' .
Unlike Proudhon , he argued that , it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature . '
In 1844 in Germany the posthegelian philosopher Max Stirner published the book The Ego and Its Own which will later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism .
Anarchists active in the 1848 Revolution in France , included Anselme Bellegarrigue , Ernest Coeurderoy , Joseph Déjacque and Pierre Joseph Proudhon .
In Europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 , during which ten countries had experienced brief or longterm social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings .
After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists , anarchists , liberals , and nationalists , to prevent further revolt .
In 1864 the International Workingmens Association united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon , Blanquists , Philadelphes , English trade unionists , socialists and social democrats .
Due to its links to active workersmovements , the International became a significant organization .
Karl Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council .
Proudhon's followers , the mutualists , opposed Marx's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings .
In 1868 , following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom , Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International .
They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property .
At first , the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction .
Subsequently , the International became polarised into two camps , with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads .
Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that , if a Marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against .
Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports thatThe annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune , and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London .
One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy , while a technical excuse that they had split away from the Fédération Romande was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters .
Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present , and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously .
Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers . '
In 1872 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress , where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York .
In response , the federalist sections formed their own International at the St Imier Congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist program .
The Paris Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March to 28 May 1871 .
The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the FrancoPrussian War .
Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune .
They included George Woodcock manifests that The antiauthoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarchosyndicalists , seeking toreplace the privilege and authority of the Statewith thefree and spontaneous organization of labor . '
In 1886 , the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886 , as the date by which the eighthour work day would become standard .
In response , unions across the United States prepared a general strike in support of the event .
On 3 May , in Chicago , a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line , and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd .
The next day , 4 May , anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square .
A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer .
In the ensuing panic , police opened fire on the crowd and each other .
Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed .
Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer .
The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement .
Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution .
The incident became known as the Haymarket affair , and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eighthour day .
In 1890 a second attempt , this time international in scope , to organise for the eighthour day was made .
The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair .
Although it had initially been conceived as a onceoff event , by the following year the celebration of International Workers Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday .
In 1907 , the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries , among which important figures of the anarchist movement , including Errico Malatesta , Pierre Monatte , Luigi Fabbri , Benoît Broutchoux , Emma Goldman , Rudolf Rocker , and Christiaan Cornelissen .
Various themes were treated during the Congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism .
A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism .
Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue , as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution , while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient .
He thought that the tradeunion movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and antiworker the phenomenon of professional union officials .
Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarchosyndicalist movement ; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain .
The most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo , founded in 1910 .
Before the 1940s , the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics , attracting 1 . 58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War .
The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association , a federation of anarchosyndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 , with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America .
In Latin America in particularThe anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America , and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in Mexico , Brazil , Peru , Chile , and Argentina were anarchosyndicalist in general outlook ; the prestige of the Spanish C . N . T . as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation .
The largest and most militant of these organizations was the Federación Obrera Regional Argentinanbsp ; . . . it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions . '
Some anarchists , such as Johann Most , advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counterrevolutionaries becausewe preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda . '
By the 1880s , people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan , propaganda of the deedto refer to individual bombings , regicides , and tyrannicides .
From 1905 onwards , the Russian counterparts of these antisyndicalist anarchistcommunists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegalexpropriations' . '
Illegalism as a practice emerged and within itThe acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins and the anarchist burglars expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society .
Moreover , they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt . ' .
France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism .
