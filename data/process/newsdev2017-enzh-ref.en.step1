new questions over california water project
critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who 's paying for a proposed $ 16 billion water project backed by gov. jerry brown , after a leading california water district said brown 's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels .
critics said the government funding described by the los angeles-based metropolitan water district on thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts , not california itself , would pay for brown 's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the sacramento river south , mainly for central and southern california .
the $ 248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels , which have yet to win regulatory approval , already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit .
on wednesday , state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well .
on thursday , state spokeswoman nancy vogel said that despite the account of the los angeles-based metropolitan water district , no money from the state 's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels .
however , opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical thursday , and assemblywoman susan eggman , one of the state lawmakers behind this week 's audit order , asked the state thursday for clarification .
" it 's a shell game , " said david wolfe , the howard jarvis taxpayers association 's legislative director .
i think it comes back to the audit ( request ) yesterday : there are way more questions here than there are answers .
the tunnels project is endorsed by brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in central and southern california .
supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer californians a more secure water supply .
opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the sacramento river and san francisco bay , harming northern california and further endangering native species there .
metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them , out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile .
the same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval .
on thursday , a monthly report published by the la-based water district on the tunnels project said , " the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources . "
after all that local water districts had spent on the project , including $ 63 million from his water district , " this is to be expected " that the state would use government money to close out planning , said bob muir , spokesman for the la-based water district .
he referred further questions to vogel , the state spokeswoman .
vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing , half-century-old water network , the state water project .
tunnel opponents , however , point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them .
" project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they 've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation , " said patricia schifferle , an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels .
it raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found .
business groups appeal to china over cybersecurity law
a coalition of international business groups has appealed to china to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country .
the letter to chinese premier li keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the united states , europe , asia and latin america , reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to china 's market for information security products .
signers include the u.s. chamber of commerce , the european services forum and groups from japan , korea and mexico .
the proposed rules would require providers to show chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about chinese citizens within the country .
the latest letter , dated wednesday , says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to chinese customers .
tianjin chemical blast : deadly disaster marked one year on
zhang mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the tianjin blasts
china 's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people , but not everyone agrees .
john sudworth reports from tianjin .
almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching .
but not in china .
while a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of tianjin , elsewhere the tributes are being muted .
the communist party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors , as well as family members of the dead , are being warned not to speak to the foreign press .
but 23-year-old zhang mengfan wo n't stay quiet .
" on this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened , " he tells me .
i do n't want silence .
on 12 august last year , mr zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade , stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions .
" the call came in at 10 : 53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates , " he says .
it would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene .
other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot .
all of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored , way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management .
the fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat .
it then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer .
the resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where zhang mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene .
those reports never came in .
" when i saw the mushroom cloud i fell into a state of desperation , " he tells me .
i knew what it would mean for my friends .
of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night , eight never came back .
many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries .
the biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event , with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away .
the total cost of the damage was put at more than $ 1bn , including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed .
a total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters .
eight bodies have never been found .
an official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption , political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden .
the storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place .
more than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation .
so while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain .
the disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life .
the bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero , there is the other uncomfortable picture .
that of the firefighter as victim , sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable , man-made catastrophe .
zhang mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in tianjin .
he will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades .
what i want to tell them most is this : i 've been to visit your parents and they are fine .
leave your parents to me .
i am a member of your family now .
i will fulfil your filial duty .
cold spring could affect scottish grouse shooting season
scotland 's grouse shooting season will begin later , with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year .
several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions .
marking the start of the season , the scottish gamekeepers association ( sga ) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the edinburgh festivals .
but animal protection charity onekind called for an end to the " brutal slaughter " of the birds .
the organisation 's director harry huyton said : " the effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices . "
it is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel , unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in scotland .
but landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy .
the sga 's chairman , alex hogg , said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a " rich seam of employment " in uncertain times .
he said : " compared to many other european countries , scotland does not have an embedded ' hunting ' culture and chunks of the population do n't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country , economically . "
mr hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the edinburgh international festival , the fringe , tattoo and hogmanay combined .
he added : " there are real concerns for employment in rural scotland at the moment , particularly in oil and gas , so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow .
we want to work with the scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future .
rspb scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors
many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular , but the sga said the industry had made " significant strides in terms of best practice . "
the opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the " glorious twelfth . "
however , the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies .
on thursday , rspb scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the monadhliath mountains , south-east of inverness , in less than five years .
the wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed .
scottish environment secretary roseanna cunningham said the reports were " very disturbing and disappointing . "
ms cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags , to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity .
the scottish moorland group accused the rspb of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the monadhliath area .

league of ireland premier division : finn harps 0-5 derry city
aaron mceneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at finn park
derry city have moved up to second in the premier division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over finn harps .
aaron mceneff put the candystripes in control with two first-half penalties , both given for fouls on lukas schubert .
nathan boyle fired home early in the second half and schubert hammered in the fourth before keith ward 's late lob completed the finn park rout .
derry go a point ahead of cork city and the teams meet at the brandywell on monday night in a crunch encounter .
it was derry 's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing harps side .
mceneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after ciaran coll 's challenge on schubert , although the foul appeared to be outside the box .
there was no doubt the second spot-kick , with former candystripes midfielder barry molloy bringing downing schubert and mceneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break .
boyle produced a clinical finish from a dean jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart .
city keeper gerard doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny david scully in the host 's best opening of the game .
schubert flicked the ball past coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by ward 's clever chip over harps stopper richard brush .
it was derry 's biggest win of the campaign and perfect preparation for the showdown with cork .
probe after mass failure of inverness college uhi course
an entire class of 20 students may have failed a higher media course run by inverness college uhi .
most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university .
inverness college uhi said quality assurance processes were in place , adding that the scottish qualifications authority ( sqa ) was investigating .
a spokesman for the sqa said the nationally-available 2016 higher media assessment had " performed as intended . "
twenty students signed up for the inverness college uhi-run and marked course .
many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online , but also had to make frequent visits to the college in inverness from where they lived in places such as lochaber .
a father of one of the students said that , following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work , at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work .
he told bbc news scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at inverness college uhi last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them .
the situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the university of glasgow , but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school .
but her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now " in limbo " and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places .
inverness college uhi is part of the university of the highlands and islands .
diane rawlinson , principal and chief executive at inverness college uhi , said : " we take exam results and student success very seriously . "
this is evidenced by the excellent hmie report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both further and higher education .
as we do every year , we are undertaking a review of all published results , comparing them against those projected for each student .
in the case of this particular course , the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported ' significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award ' and confirmed that ' assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set ' .
sqa are currently investigating this matter at our request .
a spokesman for the sqa said : " we are happy that the 2016 higher media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject .
many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the a-c attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year .
it was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications .
brothers jailed for samurai sword ' bloodbath ' in kilmarnock
jason bryden was attacked with a samurai sword , knife and nunchucks
two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in east ayrshire turned into a " bloodbath . "
the victim , jason bryden , 38 , was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in kilmarnock on 5 july 2015 .
at the high court in glasgow , james clark , 36 , was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder .
his brother john , 38 , was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide .
jailing both men , judge bill dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out " a merciless , relentless and savage attack . "
he rejected any suggestion that mr bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword .
judge dunlop added : " you together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks .
jason bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son , a father and a friend .
he was butchered by you .
after both men were jailed , det insp david moran , who led the investigation , said : " the violent and terrible actions of john and james clark caused the death of jason bryden . "
to be taken at the age of 38 , in such horrifying circumstances , is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure .
the court previously heard the brothers , from kilmarnock , had decided to rob mr bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs .
the pair , who were high on drink and drugs , went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks .
the sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man .
neighbours said they could see the clarks attacking mr bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming .
prosecutor richard goddard told the trial : " this was a sustained , frenzied attack on this man . "
afterwards , the scene of the killing was described as a " bloodbath . "
in addition to the stab wounds , mr bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault .
he died in kilmarnock 's crosshouse hospital three days later .
both brothers denied the killing .
in evidence , james clark , who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder , said : " i did n't mean it . it was an accident . "
john clark , who has 23 previous convictions , said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by mr bryden .
man jailed for shaking and killing his baby son
david sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in east kilbride in 2012
a man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months .
david sinclair shook four-month-old joshua in a " momentary loss of control " at their home in east kilbride , south lanarkshire , on 6 december 2012 .
the cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts .
sinclair , 34 , was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide .
jailing him at the high court in glasgow , judge lord bracadale told sinclair : " you assaulted your baby son by shaking him , causing the injuries which killed him . "
you must have known at the time you had shaken him , but you did not disclose that .
it was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done .
your wife believed in you .
she now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you .
lord bracadale described the effects of joshua 's death as " catastrophic " for all concerned and added : " nothing can bring joshua back . "
the court previously heard that that on the day the child died , sinclair and his wife kirsty had gone swimming with joshua and then shopping in east kilbride .
at 17 : 30 kirsty sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister .
just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from sinclair , who sounded " shocked . "
he told her : " joshua is n't breathing properly , come home right away . "
he then hung up and dialled 999 .
the infant was rushed to hairmyres hospital where he died .
initially the cause of joshua 's death was unascertained , but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally , close to the time of death .
one of the experts , dr peter richards , consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at john radcliffe hospital , oxford , said : " this would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life . "
defending qc , ian duguid , told the court that sinclair was " extremely remorseful " for his actions .
rio olympics 2016 : chloe tutton appears to question yulia efimova
gb 's tutton misses 200 m breaststroke bronze
great britain 's chloe tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer yulia efimova 's presence in rio after the russian finished ahead of her in the 200 m breaststroke .
efimova , who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban , took silver with tutton fourth .
" i would 've preferred it to have been a completely clean games , " the 20-year-old welsh swimmer said afterwards .
i could n't help who was here .
i 'm not happy with it , but that 's how it is .
efimova in second place did n't even know she was in the games until three days ago .
i do n't want to see people taken out of the sport , but i do n't think that 's quite right .
she should n't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from britain should have had a medal .
rie kaneto won japan 's seventh gold medal at rio 2016 to beat efimova into silver .
china 's jinglin shi won bronze , just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed tutton .
her british team-mate molly renshaw , 20 , finished sixth .
" being fourth is a bit gutting , no matter who is in front of you , " tutton added .
it 's a great experience and i 'm a bit disappointed to come fourth .
i 'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream .
but just to get into the final is a great experience that i 'll take on with me for years to come .
it was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time i 'll get closer .
tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the british record in the women 's 200 m breaststroke final
' everyone should have a second chance ' - efimova
efimova , who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past , defended her right to compete at rio .
she was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system .
the court of arbitration for sport ( cas ) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned .
cas considered my appeal and i won .
if someone dislikes it and has a different opinion , they can go to cas , " she explained .
i am not for doping and i have never used it .
the second case was completely not my fault .
everyone should have a second chance .
when you drive and you are just issued a ticket , no-one puts you in jail .
ben proud powers to 50 m freestyle final
earlier , ben proud set a british record to reach the men 's 50 m freestyle final .
commonwealth champion proud , 21 , swam a time of 21.54 seconds to qualify fifth fastest for friday 's final ( 02 : 44 bst saturday ) .
your delegation is pushy and rude
india 's sports minister , vijay goel , has been a conspicuous presence at rio 's olympic games , frequently spotted in the stands cheering on indian athletes and taking selfies after their events .
but he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of olympic officials with unruly behavior , repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked , the press trust of india reported .
vijay goel , pictured in july , has defended his behaviour .
on wednesday , olympic organizers threatened to withdraw goel 's accreditation if the behavior did not improve , sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held .
" we have had multiple reports of your minister for sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals , " sarah peterson , continental manager of the rio 2016 organizing committee wrote in the note .
when the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed , they reported that the people with the minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff .
" should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior , the accreditation of your minister for sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the olympic games withdrawn , " the letter continued .
the leader of the indian delegation called the matter " a non-issue being made an issue " and goel himself said he had done nothing wrong , chalking it up to a " misunderstanding . "
he tweeted , " to my knowledge , we have been following all rules & regulations .
we are committed to the spirit of olympics & back our indian players .
otherwise it 's been a gloomy olympics for india , with zero medals so far .
bummed-out fans on social media noted that michael phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as india has won in its history .
several prominent contenders have already been eliminated , including shooter abhinav bindra who won a gold medal in beijing in 2008 .
he placed fourth this time .
what a waste of money and opportunity , " author and columnist shobhaa de said in a sardonic tweet .
but some bright hopes remain , with competitors foraging ahead in boxing , golf , tennis , track and field and , yes , badminton .
the lone indian woman gymnast , dipa karmakar , will compete in the vault finals on sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution " vault of death , " the produnova , attempted by few other gymnasts .
for a country of 1.25 billion people , india 's low medal count has always been a source of consternation .
analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this .
the national obsession is cricket , which is not an olympic sport .
india has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for olympians - karmakar 's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter .
parents have historically emphasized academics over sport .
and the sports ' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption .
the international olympic committee suspended the indian olympic association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges .
in sochi , india 's three winter olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country , carry the flag or wear the insignia .
they competed as independents .

dea 's missed opportunity on medical marijuana
the answer sadly is : unlikely .
and this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people .
up until today , there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana , at the university of mississippi .
in a bit of seemingly positive news today , the dea also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same .
the hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity .
while this will be hailed as a victory for research , it will largely be symbolic , because no matter how much marijuana is available , if access is still difficult , it hardly matters .
imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door .
in response to the demand for the product , someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door .
marijuana is that product , and its schedule i designation is that locked door .
that is the predicament of medical marijuana .
because marijuana is a schedule i substance ( meaning that by definition it has " no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse " ) , there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked .
potential researchers typically go to the dea first , as it grants the license to begin scientific research .
even if a license is granted , to study a schedule i substance , institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed , which can be expensive .
there is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a schedule i status substance in the first place .
even if individual faculty members want to do that research , the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press .
this happened at the university of arizona when dr. sue sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial .
sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project , and just in april , seven years after the study was initially proposed , hers became the first dea approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans .
then , after years of bureaucratic hurdles , it is the national institute on drug abuse that has held the final key to the lock .
today , it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself .
even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research , the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds .
the problem , however , is that last word in its name : " abuse . "
according to dr. donald abrams at the university of san francisco , whom i interviewed for my documentary " weed , " the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine .
abrams makes an important point .
even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above , the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm .
consider this : a quick ( and admittedly non-scientific ) search through the u.s. national library of medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years .
that same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits .
the vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana , such as " bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis , " " cannabis induced pancreatitits " and " marijuana use and risk of lung cancer . "
that imbalance paints a highly distorted picture .
the road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look .
while the dea continues to dig in on schedule i status , deeming no medical benefit , the u.s. department of health and human services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes .
the dea continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and lsd as drugs with high abuse potential even though the dea 's own former chief administrative law judge , francis young , disagreed with this .
in strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume .
for example , eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response .
by comparison , it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death .
marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man .
by any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care .
again , that was from a judge with the dea itself .
and yet nearly 30 years later , little has changed .
whether we realize it or not , we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives .
maybe we do n't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed .
with regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy , however , it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts .
the lives of patients -- such as that of charlotte figi , whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana , and so many others -- depend on it .
that a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about .
bloody beetroots : donald trump ' a blonde berlusconi '
the bloody beetroots is known for electronic dance music
the musicians say trump 's dominance of the media is similar to berlusconi 's
" you know , we used to have berlusconi in italy and to me , trump looks like a blonde berlusconi , " rifo , who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation , the bloody beetroots , told cnn .
the republican presidential nominee and the italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities , their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media .
as the bloody beetroots , rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary sir paul mccartney to electro-pop singer greta svabo bech in the 2013 song , " chronicles of a fallen love . "
rifo was born in the italian town of bessano del grappa outside venice in 1977 , which is around the time punk rock was born , and the numbers " 1977 " are tattooed across the musician 's chest .
" english is not my main language so i do n't understand everything about your world , " rifo said from behind a black mask , which he is known for .
i try to explore and i 've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture .
rifo urged americans to watch " videocracy , " a documentary which explores berlusconi 's monopoly over the italian media .
the documentary is about " how berlusconi used to drive italy crazy , " rifo said , adding that trump has had a similar effect on america .
" you see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants , " he said .
trump , to me , looks like something that is not good for this country .
two turkish sailors jailed over £ 500 million drugs bust
two turkish men convicted of smuggling £ 500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the north sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years .
mumin sahin and emin ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the high court in glasgow after three tonnes of the class a drug were discovered inside the mv hamal about 100 miles off the coast of aberdeen .
the 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in europe .
mumin sahin and emin ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal
the massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in british history
the drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the tanzanian-registered tugboat , which was sailing from istanbul to tenerife and then to the north sea .
it was stopped by the royal navy frigate hms somerset and border force cutter hmc valiant .
sahin , 47 , was sentenced to 22 years while ozmen , 51 , was handed down a 20-year term at the high court in glasgow .
judge lord kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was ' not only significant but massive ' and drugs trafficking had a ' devastating impact ' on people and communities .
he said : ' you were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship , in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries . '
he told the ship 's captain sahin , he was ' not at the top of the drugs tree ' but had played an important role in the offence , while second captain ozmen 's role was ' to some extent a lesser one ' .
officers boarded the hamal following a tip-off from french customs body dnred , and once it was docked in aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes , with an estimated street value of £ 512 million .
mv hamal was boarded by the royal navy last year .
three tonnes of cocaine was onboard
tonnes of the class-a drug were crammed in the ship 's ballast tank when it was raided
the ship went from the bosporus to south america before being stopped in the north sea
the entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew 's quarters , with the opening cemented over .
sahin and ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between february 20 and april 23 last year , and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between april 21 and april 23 .
the men , both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school , continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury 's verdict .
charges against four other men were found not proven .
sahin 's lawyer , jonathan crowe , said the married father-of-two was a ' glorified mule ' .
he said : ' someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs . '
someone who was able to captain a boat .
in regard to the drugs hierarchy , mr sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down .
the sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane
police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes
sahin was approached about captaining the hamal in february 2015 , the court heard .
mr crowe said he is ' devastated ' about missing out on milestones for his daughter , nine , and son , 13 , and ' just wants to go home to turkey ' .
both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in april 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval .
ozmen 's lawyer , di moore , said he is ' desperate ' to see his family but knows that will ' remain impossible ' for the foreseeable future .
speaking following today 's sentencing , scotland 's crown agent prosecutor david harvie said : ' the international drugs trade does not respect borders , and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead .
' scotland 's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals . '
drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat , including under the floors
this package of contraband was found hidden in the ship 's laundry room by officers
mr harvie added : ' the hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from french authorities , and swift co-operation from the attorney general in tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded .
' our investigation then stretched from guyana , who provided access to crucial shipping records , to spain , who gave us crucial information on the ship 's stop-offs in the canary islands .
we also worked with colleagues in denmark , norway and the united states to piece specific elements of the evidence together .
despite strong intelligence that the hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs , it could not be boarded in international waters by the uk authorities without the permission of the tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted .
sue patten , head of the crown prosecution service ( cps ) international justice and organised crime division , said : ' acting quickly and precisely , the cps criminal justice adviser in tanzania was able get permission from the tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence .
under international maritime law , the uk cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so .
without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser , there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice .
photographer brian romeijn captures the decaying ' orient express ' train
rotterdam-based photographer brian romeijn snapped these photos of an abandoned train in belgium
images show the train 's rusting exterior , torn seats , dust-covered windows and compact engineer 's room
it has gained a reputation as an orient express carriage , but it belonged to belgium 's national operator
an urban explorer has captured these remarkable photos of the decaying remains of a passenger train that was once one of the finest ways to travel .
with their glory days long gone , the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in belgium , where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers .
rotterdam-based photographer brian romeijn , 40 , snapped these eerie images , which show the abandoned train 's rusting exterior , torn seats , dust-covered windows and floors and compact engineer 's room .
the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in belgium , attracting urban explorers
those trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under that legendary name from 1883 to 2009 .
the locomotive was used by belgium 's national rail company around 50 years ago .
after 126 years on the rails , the last train service operating under the orient express name was from strasbourg to vienna in december 2009 , bringing an end to a celebrated history .
the orient express famously operated between paris and istanbul .
when it started in 1883 - run by la compagnie internationale des wagons-lits - it was known as the express d ' orient .
it became the orient express in 1891 and by the 1930s operated scheduled services throughout europe .
it 's not to be confused with the privately run venice simplon-orient-express .
very few compagnie internationale des wagons-lits luxury carriages still exist .
this snap shows the compact engineer 's room , where equipment is rusting , gauges are still installed and wires are exposed
romeijn said the engineer 's room was ' kind of claustrophobic and the noise of the engine must have been tremendous '
the abandoned locomotive and carriage have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers
after visiting the forgotten train in belgium , romeijn told mailonline travel : ' i really could feel how it must have been used in its heyday .
wealthy gentlemen with high hats are joined by ladies in beautiful dresses on their journey .

lancashire father banned from children 's school after wearing t-shirt with swear word
a father-of-two has been banned from his children 's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive t-shirt .
craig mcbeth , 36 , from burnley , in lancashire , says he ' accidentally ' wore the top with the slogan " let 's get out there and t * * t it ' .
but despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the t-shirt inside out , the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds .
the single father , who had been a governor for four years at park primary school , in colne , burnley , was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police .
craig mcbeth , 36 , from burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive t-shirt to his children 's sports day
mr burnley has accused head teacher sarah midgely of overreacting .
he said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the t-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete .
the dad , who has now quit as a school governor , said : " it was a mistake , and an oversight on my part .
i was not thinking about sports day and rushing when i put it on .
towards the end of the event we were having a father 's race and the head teacher noticed my t-shirt and said it was not appropriate .
i apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter .
but the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day , but he did not see the need after he had already apologised .
" the headteacher then phoned me and said i was barred from the school premises , " added mr burnley ,
i found out after the sports day some of the parents went on facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested .
any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction .
mr mcbeth , who is the editor of an online magazine called love mini , said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term , because of the ban .
but this prompted a phone call from the school and social services .
the t-shirt had a picture of craig charles 's character lister from the cult bbc comedy red dwarf with one of his iconic lines - ' let 's go out and t * * t it . '
he commented : " i told them i was not there because they had banned me from the school .
i then got a phone call from social services asking why i had not picked my daughter up .
the school also called the police because i did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes .
mr mcbeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice .
he says he was also warned he could face a fine of £ 500 if found trespassing .
sarah midgley , headteacher at park primary school , said this matter is now closed
sarah midgley , headteacher at park primary school , said : " i can confirm that mr mcbeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school .
this matter is now closed and i 'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in september .
burnley councillor joe cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines .
" we all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard , " he said .
councillor jonathan nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion .
mr nixon added : " he was stupid to wear the t-shirt and he apologised at the time . "
lancashire police confirmed they were called by the school , but did not attend .
65 % of venezuelans want to oust maduro , the question is if they are willing to fight for it
two out of three venezuelans want to revoke president nicolas maduro , but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it .
the day after the national electoral board announced that there is " no time " for the recall vote to take place this year - securing chavismo 's grip of power until 2019 - people in caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened .
" i did n't hear the news because i was watching the olympics and how michael phelps won two more medals , " said rafael deyan , a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in altamira square on wednesday .
altamira square , located in the east of caracas , was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against maduro 's regime .
yet now , when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year , people across the country are not showing the same energy .
" i want a referendum , but i wo n't protest for security reasons , " said deyan .
others , more informed , are willing to mobilize in the future but admit venezuelans are less motivated .
electoral board president tibisay lucena 's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process .
i will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest , but i know that some of my friends are scared , " roberto reyes , 60 , told fox news latino .
so on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum , the opposition now faces another challenge : motivating people to go out to the streets and protest .
until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase .
but when it comes to protesting against the government 's maneuvers to block the effort , turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low .
" some people are focused in making food lines , while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014 , " said cipriano heredia , a lawmaker for the opposition .
after lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until october , those opposed to the socialist government claim president maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage venezuelans , making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible .
according to the constitution , if the referendum were to be held in 2017 , maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor .
if he were ousted this year , however , he is mandated to call for a general election .
the u.s. department of state addressed the issue in a statement thursday afternoon , calling on the venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the venezuelan people .
" the remaining steps for the realization of the presidential recall referendum need to be pursued clearly , concretely and without delay , and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political , economic and social difficulties in the country , " it read .
luis salamanca , a political analyst who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009 , said change is not likely anytime soon .
" i think that there will not be a referendum this year , unless the social unrest and protests grow much more , " he told fnl .
he said that in his view lucena and the government are breaking the law , but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people do n't protest loud enough .
the opposition has called for a big rally on sept . 1st in caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year .
we want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day .
the government will feel the pressure , " heredia said .
but salamanca thinks that the situation ca n't wait that long .
" they should have a quicker and stronger response to lucena 's announcement because it practically kills the referendum , " the expert told fnl .
congressman heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner , but other groups prefer to have more time to organize .
the opposition has to be careful now .
if people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition , " said salamanca .
the referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country 's electorate , close to 4 million people , in order to be activated .
salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017 , chavismo will be hurt .
but some are not that optimistic .
our party wants political change this year .
" if the government closes down the electoral path , we will have to explore other legal options , " heredia told fnl .
premier league 2016-17 previews no19 west bromwich albion
guardian writers " predicted position 14th ( nb : this is not necessarily alan smith 's prediction but the average of our writers " tips )
last season 's position 14th
odds to win the league ( via oddschecker ) 1,000-1
until last week it looked like a case of new season , same old west bromwich albion : 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic tony pulis .
but then jeremy peace sold his 88 % stake in the club to guochuan lai and pulis , the archetypal safe pair of hands , was immediately made the bookmakers " favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired .
the landscape has undeniably altered in the black country - and not just at the hawthorns , but a few miles north-west in wolverhampton , too , where new chinese owners wasted no time in relieving kenny jackett of his services .
pulis , however , has been given reassurances by lai that his job is not in immediate threat , and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture .
" i have no wish to change the club 's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree , " he said upon taking over .
i want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term .
first and foremost , our goal is to ensure that we remain in the premier league and then beyond that , i would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division .
i believe it is the best league in the world and i want to take this club as far as possible .
such is pulis 's record , the first aspect should not be too problematic .
the next aim is to break into the top half of the table , but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides .
to progress from last season 's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front .
only aston villa , tailed off at the bottom , scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at christmas albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes , by some stretch the division 's worst .
they failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions .
of their 10 victories , not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0 .
predictably , a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces .
little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at the hawthorns , perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with villa in late january , when the visitors looked the more likely .
on the flip side , only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves .
those defenders are often underappreciated , not least jonny evans , who is said to have arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis .
the northern ireland international enjoyed a fine european championship and it would take a hefty fee for albion to sell .
ben foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield .
darren fletcher , much like evans , displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32 , and claudio yacob is underrated .
irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of saido berahino 's future remains unresolved .
bids from stoke and crystal palace were rejected under peace 's ownership but the former remain keen and mark hughes is happy to be patient .
after last season was close to a write-off , it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through .
the striker is undoubtedly talented but with , as pulis mentioned more than once , people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable .
albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former england under-21 international go but their £ 15 m move for diafra sakho broke down days before the takeover , with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season .
it places a lot of pressure on the venezuelan salomón rondón , who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals , especially if rickie lambert continues to be as ineffective .
the decision to release victor anichebe and stéphane sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect .
pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - jonathan leko , sam field and tyler roberts - in the final game of last season , a 1-1 draw with liverpool , is unlikely to become the norm .
he will return to the tried and tested but leko is worth keeping an eye on .
the 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season , becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the premier league , and is also highly rated in the england underage system .
matt phillips , a £ 5.5 m signing from queens park rangers , will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign .
it is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one .
" all over , " pulis told the express and star last month about where needs to be strengthened .
every position that you look at .
the back players , midfield players and front players , we have to strengthen .
the targets have been there , we know what we want .
getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged , mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process .
the season could be defined by how they start , with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of tottenham , liverpool , manchester city and leicester from mid-october .
by that point the pressure on pulis will have eased or become insurmountable .
and , who knows , maybe even berahino will have found a new club .
tata steel uk rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes
the pension trustees behind tata steel uk have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the pension protection fund ( ppf ) , boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company .
the british steel pension scheme has liabilities of £ 15bn and a deficit of as much as £ 700 m by some measures , making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for tata steel uk and the port talbot steelworks in wales .
tata steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its uk business , which employs 11,000 people , after talks with the business secretary and the pensions regulator .
the company plans to merge its european operations , including the uk business , with those of thyssenkrupp , the german conglomerate .
however , the deal is conditional on the british steel pension scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support .
allan johnston , chair of the pension trustees , said the scheme could avoid falling into the ppf if the benefits for workers were modified .
although it is well-funded compared with other schemes , with the deficit narrowing to £ 300 m on some measures , tata steel and thyssenkrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control .
johnston said the trustees accepted it " would not be realistic " for the joint venture or any buyer of tata steel uk to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit .
modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the ppf , he added , where workers would have to accept reduced terms .
tata steel sources have warned it could still sell port talbot .
the company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its uk business in march , and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the british government .
koushik chatterjee , executive director of tata steel europe , said the indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business " more sustainable . "
speaking at the sidelines of tata steel 's annual meeting in india , chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing , but he insisted the scheme is well-funded .
" we are discussing with various stakeholders , including the british government and other stakeholders like the government of wales and so on , " chatterjee said , according to the times of india .
there is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel , so we have to find a structural solution , which does not impact the business going forward .
the pension trustees " willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by tata steel .
the potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index , as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law .
johnston added : " the trustee and its advisers have provided tata steel , the government and the pensions regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme 's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the pension protection fund .
our investment strategy has meant that the scheme 's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other uk pension schemes , and we remain confident of the scheme 's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis .

mr. xiao felt that he was wronged and reported the incident to the school bus company he belongs to . after discussion with leaders of the company , he decided to call the police .
due to pressure from the police , mr. gong surrendered himself to the wutonghu police station of the liangzihu branch of the ezhou municipal public security bureau on august 10 .
meanwhile , dens and stores involving production , marketing , repair , modification and assembly of motorcycles and electric bikes will be eliminated .

the custody business had achieved an average annual growth rate of 52.89 % in the past six years , covering fund , insurance , trust , bank financial management , pension , cross-border investment , social welfare , transaction payment and many other sectors .
huang runzhong , head of the secretariat of the china banking association , said asset custody has become an important link connecting the money market , capital market and real economy . it is also an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security .
along with rapid development of china 's direct financing market and wealth management market , the asset custody market has played an increasingly important role .
data from the report on development of china 's asset custody industry in 2016 showed that the ratio of assets under custody to deposits reached 62.74 % at the end of 2015 , versus 17.11 % at the end of 2011 .
the ratio of assets under custody to total deposits of financial institutions is often used to measure the status and function of the custody sector .
it 's noteworthy that china 's asset custody mechanism is defective presently . many sectors have failed to strictly enforce the custody mechanism , or even failed to be placed under custody .
the absence of asset custody mechanism is one of the major reasons to explain the outbreak of risk events in p2p online lending , private equity funds and other sectors .
the report proposed to realize the " complete custody " model , which covers the entire institution and features all assets and complete processes , in a push to better guarantee financial security and maintain investors ' interests .
currently all p2p platforms will draw huge amounts of loan loss provisions , the value-added tax of which is not deductable as assets after the reform of replacing business tax with vat .
shenzhen recently held a special training on finance and tax for the internet finance industry , with finance and tax experts offering suggestions to the city 's internet finance enterprises .
the numerous problems faced by the city 's internet finance enterprises in finance and tax were thrust into the spotlight during the training session , which was hosted by the shenzhen internet finance association and co-organized by the shenzhen certified tax agents association .
" as cases of absconding with funds occur frequently in the industry , p2p platforms ' drawing of hue loan loss provisions has undoubtedly become an important means to stabilize investors ' confidence . "
hu mianpeng , president of the shenzhen junhexin finance and tax service agency , said that if enterprises do n't pay the loan loss provisions they have drawn , they need to pay a considerable amount of added-value tax .
" but if p2p platforms negotiate with insurance enterprises to purchase the specific product launched by the latter , it could be used for vat deduction , and then the enterprises ' costs will be reduced . "
hu advised that the shenzhen internet finance association could negotiate with insurers to make a forward-looking attempt in the pilot city of the internet finance program .
something new has been seen in the chinese a-share market presently - the stock index bounced back to 3,000 points amid a widespread bearish sentiment . behind this , retail investors ' sentiment remained subdued , while foreign investors have increased their holdings of a shares for seven consecutive months .
" i 'm less confident in the stock market above 3,000 points , and feel jittery about the expansion of new share issue " , elder stock investor mr chen told journalists of wuhan evening news .
core changes of the market become the lingering volatilities surrounding the a-share market after the abnormal fluctuations in 2015 , with many issues pending . money supply in the market remained weak , making it very hard to earn money .
an everbright securities report indicated that as a whole , the investment sentiment remained subdued in july , with new funds from individuals being on the decrease .
the decrease of transaction settlement fund balance in the securities market in july was smaller than that in june , while the net bank-securities transfers stood at negative rmb 66.6 billion .
as for the number of new investors , there were about 310,000 new investors each week in july , which still stayed at a low level .
northbound trading link ( ntl ) , which has seen continuous net inflow of foreign capital , recorded a net capital inflow of rmb 8.7 billion in july , higher than the previous month .
foreign investors ' increased holding of a shares also implies the growing attraction of the current a-share market .
for retail investors , the shanghai composite index fared well thanks to the continuous inflow of funds to the shanghai-hong kong stock connect for a long time .
there are a few changes deserving attention in terms of operation : 1 ) changes expected to be brought by launch of the shenzhen-hong kong stock connect ; 2 ) the catalysis effect arising from announcement of interim reports and third-quarter reports .
currently singapore has become the city 's third largest overseas destination for cross-border rmb settlement , second only to hong kong and taiwan .
implementation of these pilot policies has created a good financial service environment for construction of the china-singapore ( chongqing ) strategic interconnection demonstration project and promoting inland area opening-up and development .
as the application situation changes every year , the settlement threshold and scale are likely to vary from the previous year .
the administrative measures also stipulated that under the rating-based settlement publicity mechanism , applicants who have got the qualified rating need to make publicity before settlement .
units and individuals who falsify in the process of policy implementation will be disqualified for application in the same year and the next five years , and the settlement will be cancelled as well .
when the public security organ investigated the case , four relevant parties , namely , two former cooperation companies , the chairman of one of the two companies and the jointly-established hotel company , signed an " agreement " over problems in the case .
during performance of the agreement , the two parties brought each other to court again , petitioning the court to affirm invalidity of the " agreement " .
recently , the people 's court of hailar district , hulunbeier city , inner mongolia , ruled on the case .
inner mongolia hulunbeir zhongwei real estate development co. , ltd. and zhongqing ganglian ( beijing ) investment co. , ltd. jointly developed a real estate project - hulunbeir shiji tianlun hotel .
mr. dong once acted as chairman and legal representative of the hotel company after its establishment with joint contributions by the two companies .
zhongqing ganglian ( beijing ) and shiji tianlun hotel agreed that mr. dong would apply for withdrawing the case with the public security organ after performing the obligations prescribed in the agreement , and they will no longer hold mr. dong and other related personnel responsible for legal liabilities .
after mr. dong fully performs the agreement , zhongqing ganglian ( beijing ) and shiji tianlun hotel will announce a waiver of rights to hold zhongwei real estate development , mr. dong and other related persons liable for criminal and civil responsibilities .
according to the " agreement " signed on april 24 , 2014 , the four parties agreed to reach an agreement over fund embezzlement and appropriation by mr. dong and his subordinate staff .
the agreement mainly prescribed the amount of funds mr. dong should return and the return time as well as the equity transfer and legal representative change of shiji tianlun hotel company .
in october 2015 , zhongwei real estate development and mr. dong , two parties of the agreement , brought the other two parties , namely , zhongqing ganglian ( beijing ) and shiji tianlun hotel company , to court .
the defendants replied that the public security organ 's judicial audit came to the conclusion that mr. dong and the accountant embezzled and appropriated over rmb 29 million of funds .
in february 2014 , mr. dong got in touch with zhongqing ganglian ( beijing ) , and the two parties signed the " agreement " after negotiations at the public security organ 's meeting room .
mr. dong pleaded guilty , expressed confession and threw himself on the mercy of the court . he also returned the rmb 5 million of shiji tianlun hotel company .
the entrusted agent of the plaintiffs said mr. dong learned after consulting legal specialists that it was controversial whether or not the " borrowing " behavior could be criminalized .
the " agreement " was signed provided that mr. dong was convicted of the embezzlement crime , in contravention of the twelfth article of the criminal procedural law .
giving criminal sanctions and equity transfer fall into different legal scopes , and the duo ca n't be confused and traded . what 's more , equities ca n't be used to exchange for " impunity " . the " agreement " covers illegal purposes in legal forms .
the plaintiffs opined that it is the national public power of public security organ , procuratorate , court and other national legal authorities to give criminal sanctions , which is not bound by private appointments .
the agreement signed by the two parties on april 24 , 2014 violates the compulsory provisions of the national laws and regulations and infringes the social and public interests .
therefore , no matter whether mr. dong constitutes a crime , the agreement on " a waiver of rights to give criminal sanctions on the opposite side " has no legal effect .
the entrusted agent of the defendants deemed that the " agreement " is the civil understanding reached between criminal suspects and victims in the process of criminal proceedings .
the " agreement " is signed and performed to recover the victims ' financial losses to the greatest extent and reduce the criminal punishment on criminal suspects , which are not illegal purposes nor contrary to compulsory provisions of laws and regulations .
it was mr. dong 's real intention to sign the " agreement " , which was legal and effective after being signed and sealed by all the parties concerned .
the defendants thought that the " crime of position encroachment " and the " crime of funds misappropriation " are public-prosecuted cases , and it should be decided by the public security organ whether or not the case should be withdrawn , rather than the reporter .
the agreement is just an appointment , under which the victims would apply with the public security organ for withdrawal of the case after mr. dong fulfilled the agreement , which is not in conflict with the exercise of national public power to give criminal sanctions .
meanwhile , the court held that the liability for breach of contract is beyond the scope of ordinary civil agreements , and validity of the agreement should be reviewed in the process of criminal proceeding .
after receiving the alarm , the yu county government and the yangquan municipal public security bureau immediately started formulating an emergency response plan and set up a command to clarify missions and jobs , expound work measures , fulfill job duties and make a comprehensive plan .
currently the public security organ is still further investigating other alleged irregularities of the gang members .
the plaintiff deemed that there are multiple faults and mistakes in the two hospitals ' diagnosis and treatment for the plaintiff . the plaintiff claimed a compensation of rmb 833,815 from the two hospitals and brought them to court .
if all disputes are sued and filed separately , it will increase litigation exhaustion of the public and extend the time needed to settle medical disputes .

the beijing-shenyang high speed railway across the changchun-shenzhen expressway is as long as 760 meters , and features complicated construction technology and high technical requirements . it is a dominant project of liaoning section of the beijing-shenyang high speed railway .
all construction units and the vast railway builders have carried out construction in a scientific and innovative manner since the project was commenced in july 2014 , ensuring the project to proceed safely and smoothly .
closure of the bridge has laid a solid foundation for construction of the beijing-shenyang high speed railway to progress smoothly .
the beijing-shenyang high speed railway extends from the railway terminal in beijing , and passes chengde in hebei province as well as chaoyang and fuxin in liaoning province . it measures 698 kilometers in length .
" even though there is a more than four-meter drop between the river and the bridge , water will flow over the bridge in the case of flash floods . "

" workers are moulding , and the project can be basically completed in another month " , said jin mingsheng .
" take this flood prevention bank for example , the dam may collapse at any moment when flood hits , and the flood would rush into houses of residents living along the bank . now we use cement to infill a solid dam so that we could transfer residents along the bank with ease in the case of flooding in a bid to reduce property losses . "
one of my hobbies is to buy , appreciate and collect books , and the collection of the initial issues of magazines is a growing special category in my study room .
comrade deng xiaoping made the south inspection speech in the spring of 1992 , pushing the new round of reform and opening-up to carry out in full swing in the country , and the cover of this magazine has well reflected the historical background of the year .
in the upper part of the cover , comrade deng xiaoping is seen leaning forward to make strategic planning for the reform and opening-up campaign , highlighting his determination and last-ditch demeanor as a great man .
beneath the cover , it is the shenzhen special economic zone , which was under construction against the rising sun , and citizens are seen hustling for their work .
what i collect is the initial issues of magazines published during the country 's two times of publication resumption after its founding . they reflect that chinese workers are always in the forefront of the times , contribute to social development and lead progress of the times .
data showed that currently shennongjia receives around 700,000 visitors each year , while professional statistical analysis found that it is inadvisable for shennongjia to receive more than 800,000 visitors each year , which may damage resources and environment of the scenic spot .
it is predicted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to shennongjia will surge after it is inscribed to the world heritage list , while shennongjia made an early warning against the visitor number rather than blindly pursuing growth in the tourist number and income , which is laudable .
it is a necessary measure to protect the ecological environment of shennongjia , and also a sustainable tourism road to realize the harmony between man and nature as well as man and resources in scenic spots .
after being made world heritage , shennongjia has become the first heritage site in china and the second across the world to obtain three major honors , namely , the world heritage , the man and biosphere reserve and the world geopark .
in addition , shennongjia forms the watershed between the yangtze river and the han river , and covers a total of four water systems , namely , xiangxi river , yandu river , nanhe river and duhe river .
the proverb that " mountain foot and top always see different seasons - midsummer against spring or autumn against winter , with the four seasons being difficult to distinguish " has highlighted the unique and typical climatic features of shennongjia .
thereout , shennongjia 's practice of promoting sustainable tourism to protect ecological environment rather than pursuing overexploitation is worth learning and referring to by other world heritage scenic spots .
shennongjia stands out as the 50th world heritage of our country , and china has become the second biggest country in terms of the number of world heritage it secures . we shall strive to make the 50 world heritages glow and pass them on to the future generations .
for the time being , many heritage sites have been found " taking the application seriously but making light of preservation and protection , taking the exploitation seriously but making light of management " , turning the world heritage into a cash cow .
obviously , if the application for world heritage is viewed from the economic perspective , a heritage will be taken as a " golden bowl " , while its future will look grim no matter how good it is now .
there are many past experiences to learn from at home and abroad ; for instance , six world heritage sites in china received yellow card warning at the session of the world heritage committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ecological environment after overexploitation .

the latest statistical data from the federal office for migration and refugees ( bamf ) showed that germany had received a total of 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year , a sharp decrease from the number expected .
a large number of refugees from the middle east and north africa flooded into germany in 2015 , and more than 1 million refugees were registered in germany in the year .
on august 11 , wirtschaftswoche quoted weise , head of the bamf , as saying that only 240,000 refugees have entered germany year to date , far smaller than expectation .
despite the drop in the number of refugees flooding into germany , the bamf still has an arduous task . currently there are still around 500,000 asylum applications left unprocessed .
even so , an increasing number of refugees have filed lawsuits against the bamf , and some of the asylum applicants have waited for more than two years .
by the end of 2015 , nearly 2,300 cases against " nonfeasance " of the bamf had been filed .
bank of russia said that the growth was mainly attributable to reassessment of the market expectation on the country 's economy .

the international reserves of russia are jointly controlled by the russian government and the central bank of russia , and are mainly used for dealing with economic risks .
the international reserves of russia have been on the decline in recent years amid the downward economic pressure faced by the country due to the western sanctions against russia , coupling with the dropping international oil prices .
hollywood blockbusters , which are well made , star-studded and hyped , have been featured in the film market in recent years . it seemed that all people are discussing them , and go to cinema to watch them together .
then is it truly as we thought that blockbusters always rock the cinema and make a bundle of money ?
undoubtedly , the production costs of hollywood blockbusters have been surging year by year , and the growth is even far beyond that of the inflation rate .
data from chart 1 showed that the number of hollywood films , which were produced during the decade from 1995 to 2004 and cost over us $ 100 million , totaled 60 .
while the figure surged to 197 during the 11 years from 2005 to 2015 .
the sharp increase in film production number indicates a rising production cost on average , which has aroused alert of the industry .
famous directors spielberg and lucas once criticized such phenomenon in a forum activity , saying that if this continues , the industry would " implode " .
among these 29 films , the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40 % , while the lowest even reached as high as 24 % .
the average costs of physical copy , production of audio and video products and transport reached us $ 67.8 million for each film .
it is very important to make a correct estimation of the number of copies and audio and video products to be made , especially in the dvd market that adopts the marketing policy of accepting goods return .
in 2005 , dreamworks made 5 million dvd copies of shrek 2 but found a poor sales market , which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a result .
an average amount of us $ 36.6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 films for revenue sharing and compensation among directors , producers , scriptwriters , protagonists as well as other cast and crew .
for hollywood studios , the revenue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early stage , while it turns out to be an incentive for the cast and crew .
among these 29 films , profitable ones shared 9 % of income on average and one even shared as much as 18 % , while films that suffered losses also shared around 5 % of income on average .
it is noteworthy that the cast and crew would ask for share the " revenue " rather than the " profit " .
under operation of the tricky accounting system of hollywood , some films that could have made a bundle may eventually turn out to be in the red .
for instance , a report revealed about harry potter and the order of the phoenix in 2010 indicated that warner still claimed two years after distribution of the film that it lost us $ 167 million in the film , making profit sharing an empty talk .
hollywood also needs to pay a certain amount of bonus to the union formed by various working staff , while these 29 films paid an average of us $ 11.76 million for that .
in addition , the operating costs of hollywood pictures would also be shared by films , while these 29 films shared an average of us $ 14.83 million .
after deducting the sales tax and gains shared by cinemas , the film company could receive 53 % box office sales of the north america and 41 % of the world , amounting to around us $ 169 million .
after an average marketing expense of us $ 98 million for distribution was deducted , there was only around us $ 70 million left .
these 29 films each generated an average income of us $ 134.3 million from distribution of home audio and video products .
after deducting the average marketing expense of us $ 21.9 million and production cost of us $ 30.5 million , the net income stood at us $ 81.9 million on average , which topped the income list . its profit rate was much higher than that of theatrical distribution .
paid tv channels created us $ 14.6 million of income on average for these films , a little bit more than the us $ 13.3 million created by free-to-air channels .
among these 29 films , about half generated less than 1 % of income from video on demand ( vod ) , and even films released after 2011 only generated 4.1 % of income from this business .
hollywood still took a relatively conservative attitude toward vod when building the distribution system of these blockbusters .
as for derivative development , these 29 films generated an average income of us $ 11.5 million by authorizing derivative development .
yet , almost two thirds of the derivative development income came from the top two super blockbusters , and only one third of them earned more than us $ 1 million from this .
apart from the sources of income mentioned above , these hollywood blockbusters still had bits of income from aircraft broadcast and music , which averaged at us $ 2.7 million at most for each film .
surprisingly , stephen 's statistics showed that these 29 hollywood blockbusters generated us $ 14.8 million of profits on average , while the profit rate only reached 3.7 % .
if the long revenue recovery process is taken into account , this profit rate could hardly beat the inflation .
films with costs in the lowest range between us $ 100 million and us $ 125 million delivered the worst performance in profitability , and only one third of them earned money .
however , three quarters of the films with costs in the highest range of above us $ 200 million made profits .
core prompt : in 2014 , durant renewed his seven-year us $ 60 million contract with nike by signing a ten-year contract worth us $ 300 million .
durant , who once played for oklahoma city thunder in nba , will go to the golden state warriors in the next season .

he won the wimbledon championships and the u.s. open in 2015 as well as the australian open and french open in 2016 , achieving his career grand slam . the total tournament bonuses amounted to us $ 21.8 million last year .

japanese media said that japan 's foreign minister , fumio kishida , left for the philippines to pay a visit on august 11 and held talks with rodrigo duterte , president of the country , to strengthen bilateral cooperation .
both japan and the us are eager to keep close touch with the philippines in the fields including economic cooperation with the intention to prevent the philippines from swinging to china .
according to the report of the website affiliated to nihon keizai shimbun on aug . 11 , kishida will hold talks with duterte and secretary of foreign affairs , perfecto yasay , in davao , a city in the south of the philippines . this is the first talk held between a cabinet member of japan and duterte .
kishida specially went to davao city , base of duterte , instead of manila , the capital , so as to hope to confirm cooperative relationship with the philippines on the issue of the south china sea .
kerry , on the second day after participating in a relevant conference of the asean held in laos in late july , met with duterte in manila . both sides reached a consensus on the issue of respecting the arbitration ruling on the south china sea .
duterte told kerry that " the arbitration ruling will constitute the base when any negotiation is conducted . "
kerry indicated at that time that $ 32 million would be offered to the government of the philippines as assistance . it is probable that for the second time , kishida will express the intention to offer assistance to the construction of the north-south commuter rail in manila during the talks on august 11 .
according to the report , the reason why both japan and the us are eager to keep close touch with duterte is that the philippines is intensifying its effort to enhance the bilateral negotiation with china .
the us and japan have been strengthening their cooperation with the philippines . in 2014 , the us and the philippines signed a new military agreement , which , in fact , again permitted the american troops to station in the philippines 25 years later , the report said .

in this april , during the presidential campaign in the philippines , on the pretext of the issue of human rights , goldberg found fault with duterte . both sides continuously elucidated their own viewpoints and the speech conflict was intense .

on the 5th day of the month , duterte raked up old stories and again expressed his dissatisfaction with goldberg , criticizing the latter for interfering in the internal affairs of his country .

with a splendid civilization and numerous people , china stood at the forefront of the world development for several centuries . now the country has become the second largest economy in the world .
speaking of the word , we realize that it not only implies too much meaning but also carries rich contents .
without doubt , the proposition of setting up cultural self-confidence is based on the sufficient identification of their own culture value as well as the firm confidence in its vitality on the part of the cpc and the chinese people .
many people have realized that in xi jinping 's series of talks , articles , speeches and interviews , famous quotations from ancient chinese books and records as well as classics are found everywhere , manifesting highly cultural self-confidence and arousing the widespread resonance all over the world .
facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary china , the influence and attraction of the chinese culture is increasingly being strengthened .
the chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the road , theory and system are rooted in the culture .
of course , for a time , we learned from western countries about their implements , systems and cultures and kept rethinking in this process .
after a long-term exploration , we have found that the firm confidence in china 's modernization derives from the " spiritual gene " of the chinese nation .
in xi jinping 's speeches and investigations , the discussions on excellent traditional chinese culture including confucianism are beyond count .
in the 18th collective study of the cpc central committee political bureau , xi jinping all the more emphasized that china 's today is just the development of her yesterday and the day before yesterday .
he also said that for several thousand years , the chinese nation has taken her civilization development path different from those of other countries and nations .
we have not occasionally blazed the socialist road with chinese characteristics , which is determined by the historical inheritance and cultural tradition of our country .
in 2010 , china 's gdp stood second in the world . however , china ' achievements are more than economy .
since the eighteenth national congress of the communist party of china , china has attached more prominent importance to the construction of a powerful socialist cultural country , dedicated to initiating a new " golden age " of cultural development .
either excellent traditional culture , revolutionary culture or advanced socialist culture is demonstrating unprecedented vitality .
in spite of the fact that the chinese culture is time-honored and has vigorous development momentum , it cannot be denied that its current influence and function are far from reaching its due height .
though china has experienced a lost time in the past few hundred years , yet now she has returned to the world stage in a more powerful manner .
while accepting a reporter 's interview , turkish deputy prime minister mehmet simsek bluntly said that the chinese culture has made a lot of contributions to the world .
just as simsek said , today 's china is making contributions to the world in a brand-new way .
recently , the jiangning area has witnessed a new round of real estate price rise . in the latter half of the year , several developers of purely new commercial residential buildings entered the market for the first time , intending to charge the high price of 30,000 yuan per square meter .
and the initial average price of country garden century city adjacent to jiangning is 7,088 yuan per square meter . at present , the commercial houses in the first phase have been sold out .
in transportation , at present , the jiangning area boasts metro line 1 , metro line 3 and arport line s1 .
up to now , country garden century city has accommodated scheduled buses to xiaolongwan metro station and pharmaceutical university metro station for proprietors . in the later phase , with the increase of proprietors who will live in the buildings , the number of scheduled buses to metro stations will be increased .
in addition , country garden century city has the transportation facilities such as double high-speed rails and lukou airport .
in business , jiangning is divided into seven business areas , such as dongshan , jiulong lake , baijia lake , university town , sanshan , chalukou and heding bridge , which are not far away from country garden century city .
outlets in the eastern suburbs has an integrated planning area of 400,000 square meters , planning to permit over 240 international fashion brands to be stationed . at present , over 100 such brands have entered there .

at present , the houses in the initial phase of century city have been sold out . people are eagerly queuing up in lines for purchasing new delicately-decorated houses with housing area of 80 to 265 ㎡ each . only 300 customers in the city can enjoy the extra 2 % discount . early registration means early selection of houses .
another thing worth attention is that the range of the preferential railway tickets for college freshmen is between their homes and their universities . otherwise , they cannot enjoy the preferential policy .
at the same time , a freshman , on the strength of his or her letter of admission , can only purchase a student ticket once . those who have bought their tickets had better choose to alter the tickets if their journeys change instead of returning their tickets directly .
if they really need to return their tickets and ask for refunds , they can ask staff members to indicate that the tickets have been returned so as to ensure to purchase student tickets again .
only a college entrant himself or herself can purchase a preferential railway ticket via his or her letter of admission . other people accompanying him or her are not entitled to enjoy the discounted price .
" though females are playing more and more social roles , quite a number of them lack the speech right equivalent to that of males in family and society at large . "
the expert said that hence quite a number of females have the feelings of depression and anxiety to different degrees and the high-incidence age-bracket of such diseases is from 30 to 40 .
of course , in addition to the increase of the base number of patients , the increase of female patients stems from people 's high attention to psychological health .
according to xu xiangdong , facing mental problems , many people in life adopt the attitude of " dogged resistance " or avoidance toward psychological pressure .
at the same time , due to the lack of understanding of depressive disorder and anxiety ailments , common citizens erroneously think that patients are in a fit of pique instead of giving them timely understanding and emotional support , which is also the main reason for a lower outpatient rate .
" today , with people 's getting a proper understanding of psychological health and paying attention to mental health , many patients and their family members can face the disease in a right manner . "
xu xiangdong said that as a result , more and more patients are willing to enter hospitals to accept the help of professionals .

china always supports and helps africa to find solutions to problems by itself while some western countries impose their schemes on africa .
china maintains that eradicating poverty is the key to avoiding conflicts and crisis . therefore , china is dedicated to strengthening friendly exchanges in africa so as to help africa to realize sustainable development in a real way .

tomorrow morning , the municipal public security bureau will hold the activity of soliciting opinions from citizens on the improvement of the traffic environment on the square of the railway station .
however , as a window showcasing the image of xi ' an to the outside world , there are still a lot of unsatisfactory phenomena as far as the traffic environment around the railway station is concerned .
at 10 o ' clock tomorrow morning , the municipal public security bureau of xi ' an will solicit opinions from citizens and conduct on-site interactive communication with them .
the interested citizens who cannot conduct the on-site communication can dial the hot-line specially opened at the branch bureau of public security of the station .
known as the sternest anti-corruption law in the history of the republic of korea , the improper solicitation and graft act will come into force next month . according to the law , the expenses per capita of a civil servant who accepts a banquet shall not exceed 30,000 korea won ( approximately rmb 181 yuan )
according to the report by yonhap on august 10 , this stipulation poses a challenge to many first-class korean restaurants that were originally going to exclusively entertain political figures and senior civil servants .
quite a number of restaurants have to adjust the standard of table money and promote more inexpensive set meals . some restaurants have closed down or switched to other industries once and for all .
many korean restaurant bosses are worried about their future business because of the law , yonhap reported .
in insadong of seoul , a restaurant which has been doing business since 1969 is often patronized by political figures , government officials , media reporters and merchants .
the boss of the restaurant told the reporter from yonhap that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers .
in the past ten years , the restaurant has offered high-specification set meals . however , " in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by the improper solicitation and graft act , we will have to change the tradition of several decades , which is really a difficult decision . "
" charcoal fire barbecue village " mainly offers beef barbecue . according to its general manager , the price of " han-u " ( korean beef ) , a signature dish of the restaurant , is over 50,000 korean won .
" we predict that from october on , the sales volume will greatly reduce so we are considering replacing han-u in set meals with imported beef . "
located in jongno district , seoul , the restaurant which was well-known for the patronage by political vips such as former presidents roh tae-woo and lee myung-bak closed down last month .
the boss of the restaurant said that as partial korean government departments have been moved to sejong , the restaurant 's volume of business has suffered a great shock . it is estimated that after the improper solicitation and graft act takes effect , the number of guests will be even smaller .
before long , the restaurant will divert to engaging in vietnam rice noodles and the per capita dining standard is around 10,000 korean won ( rmb 60 yuan ) .
according to the prediction of the korean catering service industry association , in the first year after the improper solicitation and graft act is put into force , the income of hotel industry in s . korea will reduce by 4.15 trillion korean won ( rmb 25 billion yuan ) year on year .
facing the possible economic loss , south korean president park geun-hye said at a cabinet conference on the 10th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while sticking to the core part of the improper solicitation and graft act .
she said , " once the law is put into force , the social transparency and fairness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increase , too . therefore , the economic growth of s . korea will speed up . "
while driving vehicles in our daily life , we often go through tunnels , sometimes even super-long tunnels or tunnel groups . so , whether tunnels are safe is important to us .
meanwhile , it is stipulated that no unit or individual shall destroy , damage , illegally occupy or take advantage of highway tunnels and their subsidiary facilities .
if traffic needs to be closed or a carriageway is occupied for a long time due to the maintenance project , except for emergency situation , the management and maintenance unit shall issue to the public the information of construction and traffic control together with the traffic police department 15 days ahead of time .
many drivers have encountered the situation in which traffic jams took place in tunnels . some drivers are accustomed to smoking cigarettes in a tunnel to kill time .
when a highway tunnel is experiencing traffic congestion in the form of vehicles queuing , the traffic police department should take measures such as preventing vehicles from entering , guiding and diverting the traffic according to specific situations and issue the information of traffic jam in a timely way .
when a traffic accident takes place , it is imperative to carry out traffic control immediately to keep secondary accidents from happening through measures such as patrol and propaganda .

according to chinanews.com on august 12 , sheng laiyun , press spokesman for the national bureau of statistics said today that the surveyed urban unemployment rate in liaoning is higher than the national average level . since its economy is experiencing adjustment , the interior pressure is rather big .
today , the information office of the state council held a press conference with regard to the operation of national economy in july 2016 .
judging from the over-all situation , since the international economy is under deep adjustment , its recovery is relatively slow , which will bring about a large pressure on china 's import including the import of liaoning province .
domestically , as china is in the critical period of structural adjustment , the contradiction between the surplus of traditional industries and the inadequacy in the growth of market effective demand is rather acute and the throes caused by the adjustment of traditional industries are still being released .
therefore , in this new round of adjustment , it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is undergoing the deepest adjustment , thus inevitably bringing downward pressure on the economy of liaoning .
during the 12th five-year plan , due to the development of urbanization and the expansion of the real estate , the development of infrastructure in liaoning was sound and the base of its real estate was fairly high .
after entering the period of the 13th five-year plan , since its original base number was high , in terms of data manifestation , this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region .
sheng laiyun summarized that the economic adjustment of liaoning has its special economic reasons , including not only the influence of cyclical factors , but also that of structural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjustment .
sheng laiyun also revealed that since its economy is being adjusted , the fact that the urban unemployment rate of liaoning is higher than the national average level indicates that its interior pressure is rather big .
according to the observation of the data in the recent two months , there is an indication that the economy of liaoning will be stabilized and the index reduction degree is becoming narrow .
we believe that through the joint efforts of all aspects , the economy in the northeastern region including liaoning will display the vitality of the former old industrial base for the second time .

since its development in china , crowdfunding has shown a positive image to the public . regions across china have started improving the environment around them through crowdfunding .
not long ago , the parents in a residential quarter in nan ' an city launched a reading room for their kids through crowdfunding .
because they wanted the kids to keep a good reading habit during the summer vacation , dropping cell phones and computers to return to the most original way in recreation and entertainment .
such a reading room with love not only fostered children 's reading habits , but also offered them a good place to go during the summer vacation .
in addition to reading rooms , crowdfunding has also brought some warmth to left-behind children , a grave problem facing china now .
reportedly , there are more than 3,000 left-behind children in central and western huangyan , most of whom are living with their elderly grandparents at home . their parents have to work in other regions to earn money . therefore , they may only see their parents once a year .
the lack of kinship and correct guidance frequently become an irretrievable pity for the kids during their growth .
it seems that launching reading rooms for kids , building homes for left-behind children , as well as other meaningful things alike can only be managed through crowdfunding .
" as an emerging industry in internet finance , crowdfunding is gradually extending its advantages to all aspects . it has not only changed our living environment , but also silently changed our ideas . "
han jianyu , general manager of xf.cc , said that xf.cc is engaged in the establishment of a crowdfunding system . a staff member of the company has also raised funds through crowdfunding on wechat after his family members were attacked by a disease .
what i want to say here is that crowdfunding is not only an industry , but also a positive attitude and an accommodating spirit .
it is boundless . if you need and are brave enough to initiate crowdfunding , everything will become possible .

sources from caracas said that venezuela and colombia on august 11 agreed on the reopening of their border one year after the closure of the border .
the decision was made after president maduro of venezuela and president santos of colombia 's meeting .
according to bbc , only pedestrians will be allowed to cross in five places along the border during the first stage .
maduro said after the meeting that he hoped the reopening of the border will help venezuela resume its economic and trade communications with colombia and improve the bilateral relations between the two countries .
santos stressed that the border will be " gradually " opened . it will be a provisional opening as they learn and adjust their decisions every step of the way .
colombia and venezuela also agreed to work towards the full reopening of the border , saying they needed first to reach separate agreements on security , commerce and energy .
on august 19 last year , a group of colombian paramilitaries shot a venezuelan military patrol in riots with smugglers and wounded three soldiers and a civilian near the border .
maduro then announced 60 days of martial law in five municipalities in the state of tachira , which borders on colombia , and the close of the border of the two countries .

we always think of beautiful sceneries , mysterious culture and honest villagers while mentioning ethnic villages . however , the impoverishment , sparseness and desolation behind them cannot be ignored .
the incorrect exploration models during the development of ethnic villages not only have n't changed the destiny of the villages , but also accelerated the disappearance of the villages and their culture .
culture protection is not a static concept . for instance , guangxi 's liu sanjie will become meaningless if it is broken away from villages . no matter how excellent it is , the atmosphere of villages will be lacked when it is staged in other places .

wang xinliang noted that the elderly-cheating healthcare product companies usually adopt similar ways in cheating . they held lectures , offered presents on site and lured the elderly to buy their products .
" people who listen to the lectures can get 2.5 kg eggs for free and those who bring another person to listen to the lectures can get 2.5 kg more . "
wang xinliang said that he has once encountered a case , in which the healthcare product sellers call the elderly either fathers or mothers on lecture sites , which made the elderly feel at home . however , it was actually an emotional marketing trick .
" we felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products . however , they were marked up to rmb 3,000 one week later . then , we did n't buy them again . "
wang xinliang said that according to the cases he has encountered in recent two years . the elderly were easy to be cheated . most of the frauds took place when they buy drugs , healthcare products and wealth management products .
" some elderly people bought a great number of healthcare products . some who have high retirement pay did n't follow their kids ' advice although they knew they had been cheated . some even had conflicts with their family members . "
according to the report of an economic comment program of cnr-2 , online shopping is becoming the daily consumption means of many people . how many online shoppers will give a negative comment when shopping experience falls short of their expectations ?
about 56.4 % respondents of the survey said consumers ' right to give negative comments is an objective reflection of the public monitoring system in the virtual online society , while 79.3 % believed that it is necessary to launch relevant measures to protect consumers ' right to give negative comments .
however , merchants ' pressure should never be released through illegal means , while consumers should make good use of their rights .
if the comments of consumers are pertinent , you should accept such comments and improve your services .
if someone 's comments are aimed to weaken your competitiveness on purpose . you can safeguard your rights according to the regulations of the anti-unfair competition law .
if their malicious slanders damage your business reputation and credits , you can lodge a civil litigation or report the case to relevant authorities .
according to relevant regulations in law , if merchants publicize your information to revenge you for your comments , they are actually infringing your reputation and information security rights . however , it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a lawsuit against them .
e-commerce platforms have to give play to their monitoring role when relevant administrative departments are investigating and dealing with such cases .
on the other hand , those who publicize others ' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regulations . also , there should be a regulation on the punishment of online slanders .

at 10 o ' clock that evening , the family members of the old lady were informed that she was in the hongdao police substation after they called the police because she did not come back home , and then went to the substation to bring her home .
through observation , the worker of the bus company found that the old lady dressed properly in clean clothes , and judged that she did not look like an old woman straying outside and coming from a humble background .
since the worker could not get any valuable clues after one-hour communication , he had to escort the old lay to the nearby hongdao border police substation and hoped that the police will help the old lady find her family members .
then , the police talked with the old lady with patience , but she still could not normally communicate with them .
at 10 o ' clock that evening , mr. yang who lives on haidian island called the police and said that his 80-year-old mother got lost in the afternoon and there was no news about her till then .

then , mr. yang together with his nephew went to the police substation , and found that the old lady there was exactly his mother .
mr. yang thanked the police for their finding his mother in time and then brought her home after confirming that she 's fit .
according to mr. yang , his 80-plus-year-old mother , who hails from anhui province , told the family members that she wanted to go out for a walk this afternoon , but they did not think about that .
at about 7 : 00 pm , he had n't seen his mother coming back home yet , so he requested his relatives and friends to search his mother around his home and the haidian island , but it did not work .
he also said that his mother has never taken a bus by herself , and guessed that it might be some good-hearted people helped her go onto the bus . since she is suffered from minor senile dementia , she did not know where she had gone herself at that time .

cbc commentator confuses michael phelps with ryan lochte for whole race
an olympics commentator working for canadian broadcaster cbc suffered embarrassment on thursday night when he confused michael phelps for rival ryan lochte .
elliotte friedman mixed the pair up for the duration of the 200 m individual medley final , which phelps won to claim his 22nd olympic gold medal .
as phelps streaked home for the win , friedman believed him to be lochte , phelps ' compatriot and long-term rival at the top of world swimming .
friedman shouted : " finally , he 's going to do it ! "
ryan lochte is going to beat michael phelps in this event !
phelps might not even make the podium .
phelps , however , won while lochte trailed in fourth .
in the immediate moments after phelps touched for gold , cbc 's broadcast fell silent .
friedman , admirably , admitted to his error immediately .
i apologise , i got my lanes mixed up .
phelps with the gold , " he said .
the canadian commentator , whose professionalism has been widely praised after the mistake , owned up to his error once again in the hours after the event and apologised to viewers on twitter .
i 'm sorry everyone .
i blew it .
" no excuses , " he wrote .
phelps , meanwhile , broke a 2,168-year-old record for the most all-time individual olympic titles with the victory .
the previous record was held by leonidas of rhoses , who is believed to have won more olympic titles at the ancient games than anyone else .
parking at the happiest place on earth should be easier the find in the future .
disneyland has released details of a long-proposed parking structure , a transportation hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern end of the theme park resort .
the project , located east of the resort near the 5 freeway , includes a 6,800-space parking structure and a transportation hub where buses , shuttles , taxis and other vehicles can drop off park visitors .
a pedestrian bridge over harbor boulevard connects the resort to the parking structure and the transportation hub .
the structure , along with the 14-acre star wars land expansion project under construction , is part of a $ 1-billion investment promised to the city of anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption on an entertainment tax .
construction of the project , dubbed the eastern gateway , will begin next year .
the parking structure will be built on disney 's pumbaa parking lot , which has about 1,300 spaces .
the transportation hub will replace a commercial property that the theme park purchased in 2014 .
the project is expected to open in 2018 .
" the eastern gateway is part of our substantial investment in anaheim , which will provide additional guest parking and help to alleviate congestion in the resort district as we continue to expand the disneyland resort , " disney spokeswoman suzi brown said .
thailand bomb blasts at tourist hotspots kill four
a series of bomb blasts across five of thailand 's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on thursday and friday , leaving four people dead and many more injured , after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution .
two explosions first hit the seaside resort of hua hin on thursday night , before another blast struck on friday morning .
the town is located some 200 kilometers south of bangkok .
the first blast killed one thai woman and injured 20 people , 10 of them foreigners , police said .
authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of phuket , trang and surat thani .
two bombs exploded in the town of patong in phuket and two more in phang nga , another tourist region just north of phuket .
a total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours .
the blasts were not linked to islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage , royal thai police official col. krisana patanacharoen said on friday .
" it 's too soon to jump to any conclusion , " he said .
but what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism , in fact it 's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes .
investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in hua hin on august 12 , 2016 .
a string of bomb attacks targeting thailand 's crucial tourism industry have killed four people , officials said on august 12 , sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators .
there are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country .
" that 's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks , " he continued .
no group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group , but the explosions occurred in the same week that thai voters approved a new constitution .
the three southern provinces of hua hin , phuket and phang nga all rejected the military-backed referendum , and the muslim-majority southeastern provinces of thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004 .
the blasts came on the birthday of thailand 's queen sirikit , a public holiday in the country .
hua hin hosts the klai kangwon royal palace , or " far from worries palace , " where the country 's monarchy have often stayed .
king bhumibol adulayadej is the world 's longest-serving monarch .
signs of trouble in ukraine prompt question : what 's vladimir putin up to ?
it 's difficult to judge the truth of these claims .
ukraine denies them , and both the united states and the european union say russia has provided no evidence .
an open-source analysis group , the digital forensic research lab , found some indications of a firefight on saturday , but little to back up moscow 's grander claims .
russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends , particularly within the fog of ukraine 's still-ongoing conflict .
that does n't mean that russia 's claims are all false .
ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power crimea , and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations .
an attempted attack in crimea is not out of the question , though there is little reason to suspect the ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot .
whatever happened , images found by open-source analysts suggest that russia has been escalating its military presence in crimea since at least saturday - before the supposed attack occurred .
these show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula , including missile systems intended for coastal defense .
a disturbingly familiar russian escalation
some reports indicate that russia 's troops in crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now , which would help explain the activity , though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation .
whatever transpired over the weekend , mr. putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward ukraine , choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim .
analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how russia behaved just before previous military actions against ukraine .
in february 2014 , similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula , then still controlled by ukraine , only to reveal they were in fact russian special forces launching a military occupation .
that august , as russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern ukraine , mr. putin stationed troops along the border , warning they might be necessary to " protect " ethnic russian civilians in ukraine who he said were under attack .
he orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that , according to nato , was mere cover for a russian invasion force .
what is mr. putin planning in crimea ?
some have wondered whether moscow might be plotting another intervention .
fighting has increased in eastern ukraine , as it did before the august 2014 incursion .
but that seeming parallel may be the point , meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give mr. putin leverage with ukraine and with western countries .
mark galeotti , a new york university professor who studies russia , pointed out that crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern ukraine , which borders mainland russia but not crimea , and that the rest of the country is better defended .
" it 's highly unlikely that the russians are truly planning some major offensive , " mr. galeotti said .
rather , " we 're looking at a classic russian strategy of building up tension . "
international peace talks over ukraine , once the mechanism by which mr. putin forced contact with western leaders who had shunned him over annexing crimea , have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant .
by dangling the threat of renewed conflict , mr. putin gives the talks a new purpose : to coax him back from the brink .
" it 's a standard putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength , " mr. galeotti said of the next peace talks , planned for early september .
" and the only real strength is to say , " i could make things much , much worse if i wanted to . " "
positioning for a bargain with the west
mr. putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the crimea tensions , forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process .
what does this actually get him ?
for one , it allows russia to continue asserting itself as a global power , even though its economy is smaller than australia 's .
for another , it positions moscow as having a veto over ukraine 's sovereignty , keeping the country within some degree of russian control .
it may also serve mr. putin 's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the united states that would settle their disputes over ukraine and syria - on terms favorable to moscow , naturally - as well as ending western sanctions against russia .
mr. putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation 's economy began collapsing in late 2014 , due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports .
since intervening in syria last fall , he has repeatedly invited western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists .
but russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before january , when president obama will leave office .
russian officials tend to view hillary clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to moscow .
donald j . trump , while conspicuously friendly toward russia , is still seen as unpredictable .
but mr. obama is seen as " looking for resolutions , not conflicts , " mr. galeotti said .
so there is a sense that there 's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly .
in the meantime , should no grand bargain come , mr. putin appears happy to keep russia 's weaker neighbor guessing about what 's coming next .
an earlier version of this article misstated the year that russia annexed crimea from ukraine .
it was 2014 , not 2013 .
with congress deadlocked , white house diverts funds to fight zika
the obama administration on thursday said it was shifting $ 81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a zika vaccine , resorting to extraordinary measures because congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus .
sylvia mathews burwell , the secretary of health and human services , told members of congress in a letter that without the diverted funds , the national institutes of health and the biomedical advanced research and development authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month .
that would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time , as locally acquired cases of zika infection increase in miami .
as of last week , 7,350 cases of zika had been reported in the united states , most in puerto rico , according to the centers for disease control and prevention .
ms. burwell said that 15 infants had been born with zika-related birth defects .
the virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers .
the local spread of the illness in the continental united states , with the first cases reported late last month , has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government 's response .
hillary clinton on tuesday made a campaign stop in wynwood , the miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted zika cases , and pressed congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus .
president obama and congressional republicans have been at odds for most of the year over zika .
in february , mr. obama requested $ 1.9 billion in emergency funding .
republicans balked , demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go .
lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent .
last month , democrats blocked consideration of a republican measure that would have allocated $ 1.1 billion to fight zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for planned parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus , which can be sexually transmitted .
the deadlock prompted the white house in april to shift $ 589 million in ebola funding to the zika effort , about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use .
on thursday , ms. burwell said that her department had used most of that money , and that it would be gone by the end of august .
" the failure to pass a zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays , " ms. burwell wrote .
democrats seized on the announcement to berate republicans for failing to provide additional money for zika .
at a news conference , representative nancy pelosi of california , the minority leader , called on representative paul d . ryan , the house speaker , to bring congress back to advance such a measure .
" every possible option is being exhausted , and now we 're going into the national institutes of health , which is supposed to be a priority , " ms. pelosi said .
aides to mr. ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the zika issue .
the national institutes of health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a zika vaccine on 80 human subjects , and hoped to begin a second phase in " zika-endemic countries " in early 2017 .
but without more funding now , officials said thursday , the research would halt in its tracks .
ms. burwell said she would transfer to the zika efforts $ 34 million in n . i . h . funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases , including cancer and diabetes .
another $ 47 million will be transferred to the biomedical advanced research and development authority , which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies .
that money will come out of a variety of accounts , including $ 19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $ 4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction .
even then , ms. burwell said , the additional money will last only through next month , at which point agencies would have to " severely curtail many of their critical efforts " against zika without action from congress .
in the last four months , the centers for disease control and prevention spent $ 60 million to help states protect pregnant women , $ 25 million to strengthen their zika preparedness and response plans , and $ 16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other zika-related syndromes .
thai leader links attacks on tourist sites to constitution change
the head of the thai junta urged his countrymen on friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in thailand this week .
gen. prayuth chan-ocha , the junta chief and prime minister , hinted that the perpetrators were " bad people " opposed to a new constitution that was approved by voters on sunday in a nationwide referendum .
" there are still bad people , and they have been acting since before the referendum , " he said in an address to the nation .
the bombings in five provinces on thursday and friday , including in phuket and hua hin , areas popular with tourists , killed four people and injured dozens .
the authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related .
analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people , but rather at damaging the tourism industry , one of the few bright spots in thailand 's economy .
at least nine foreign visitors were injured in hua hin .
" whatever the motives are , the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta 's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable , " said sunai phasuk , a senior researcher at human rights watch .
these attacks create effects that discredit the authorities , terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy .
photo thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in hua hin on friday .
the police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running islamic insurgency in southern thailand .
they have portrayed the attacks as " local sabotage , " not terrorism .
the timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism .
the bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of queen sirikit on friday , which is considered mother 's day in thailand .
four bombs struck the royal residential town of hua hin , about 125 miles from bangkok , where most injuries occurred .
the military-drafted constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control .
the junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it .
murray hiebert , an expert on southeast asia at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , noted the military 's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote .
the bombings were " clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries , " he said .
last year , a bombing at the popular erewan shrine in bangkok killed 20 people , most of them tourists from china .
thai officials attributed the bombing to uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 uighurs to china .
general prayuth , who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government , said this week 's bombings " hurt the hearts " of thai people .
" why now , when the country is getting better , the economy is getting better , and tourism is getting better ? " he said .
we have to ask why , and who did it .
golden reaction : what simone manuel 's historic moment looked like
just coming into this race tonight , i kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders , which is something i carry with me just being in this position .
but i do hope that it kind of goes away .
i 'm super glad with the fact i can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport .
but at the same time i would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it 's not simone , the black swimmer , because the title black swimmer makes it seem like i 'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or i 'm not supposed to be able to break records .
that 's not true because i work just as hard as anybody else and i love the sport and i want to win just like everybody else .
the fight to protect l . g . b . t . students in colombia
two years ago , 16-year-old sergio urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in bogotá , leaving as his suicide note a facebook post quoting pink floyd 's " goodbye cruel world . "
his death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled colombia this week , as the effort to expand l . g . b . t . rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation .
after his death , mr. urrego 's mother , alba reyes , sued school officials , faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship .
a year later , colombia 's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor , calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination .
the decision was part of a string of legal victories for colombia 's gay rights movement , which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage .
this week , though , their fight for equality hit an obstacle as gina parody , the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling .
the fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media , peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry .
ms. parody quickly debunked that .
while the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling , it has not sought to impose standardized rules .
" what we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts , " ms. parody said in an interview on thursday .
the dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or the farc , a guerrilla group .
a coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the catholic church mobilized with extraordinary speed , accusing the government of president juan manuel santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity .
to complicate matters , the government delegation negotiating with the farc in havana recently reached an accord on gender and l . g . b . t . equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies .
critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on ms. parody , a 42-year-old rising star in colombian politics .
they displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner , cecilia álvarez-correa glen , the former commerce minister .
ms. parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms .
" part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet , " she said .
this is a tough stage and a very lonely time .
she also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over l . g . b . t . students .
as colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the farc , which would mark an seismic turning point for the country , they must consider the roots of the conflict , she said .
" is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion ; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities ? " she said .
while she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week , she is glad that in today 's colombia , gay students can look up to her and consider that they , too , can aspire to serve as a minister one day .
" to me , it 's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential , " ms. parody said .
we ca n't wait for a new suicide to start changing .
keeping the vote cybersafe - the new york times
in " u.s. seeking ways to keep hackers out of ballot box " ( news article , aug .
4 ) , homeland security secretary jeh johnson says the obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the nation 's electoral system .
this change may be necessary and should be considered immediately .
the diverse nature of the cyberthreat , and the recent revelation that outside actors , possibly nation-states , have an increased interest in influencing our elections , make it imperative that the federal government give additional attention to securing our electoral system and possibly deem it part of our nation 's critical infrastructure .
without delay , mr. johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer the department of homeland security 's assistance , expertise and guidance .
while the diverse and varied nature of our voting infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it , this tells us that the process should begin as soon as possible .
the writer , democrat of mississippi , is the ranking member of the house homeland security committee .
the uk government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of hinkley point nuclear power station in the uk in partnership with china and france , attracting a wide spread attention at home and abroad .
a uk government spokesman recently said that the deferral of the project does not mean the uk has chilled its enthusiasm for china , as china and the uk are still cooperating in a wide range of sectors and the uk will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with china .
some experts pointed out that china 's nuclear power leads the world in technical level , safety performance , operating experience and all other aspects , as well as has relatively low costs .
therefore , although " nuclear power going global " will experience trials and tribulations in a given period , the trend of mutually beneficial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win-win potential .
but these words clearly do not hold true for what the uk did in the project of hinkley point nuclear power station .
once the project is completed , it will meet 7 percent of the uk 's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the operation period of 60 years .
analysts generally believe that complicated factors in the uk such as exposed economic risks , increasing disputes among domestic politics , cumbersome subsequent procedures after brexit , and increasing future uncertainties all impede its nuclear power projects .
" currently , since property prices in the uk are falling and outflow of capital starts occurring , keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the uk 's new government .
meanwhile , after the approval of brexit vote , the uk also needs to face a number of brexit procedures in the coming days and straighten out its relationship with eu countries like france again .
xu mingqi said that though the uk 's new government shows apparent eagerness to " differentiate from " the previous government , it does not deny the positive significance of nuclear power projects .
over the past two decades , however , the uk has seen the stagnation of the development of its nuclear power , and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design lifetime .
according to the prediction of the uk 's energy white paper , there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the uk by 2025 , leading to major gaps in electric power supply .
for this reason , the parties express their common concerns about the suspension of this project benefiting the public welfare by the uk government .
in the view of scuoler , where it is in the interests of the both countries , china can play a key role in helping the uk reconstructing infrastructures .
liu xiaoming said that we look forward to successfully starting and implementing the project as early as possible , providing the uk with safe , reliable and sustainable energy .
according to insiders , projects of nuclear power stations are instrumental in the reduction of electricity cost for the british public , while at the same time driving local economy and employment .
so , if the uk 's new government makes a final decision from the prospective of maximizing its people 's welfare , nuclear power projects will not see a gloomy outlook .
the uk side can address energy demand gap , and the sides of both china and france can find the market for their own advantageous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power , benefiting more people . "
in spite of the increasing uncertainty of the hinkley point nuclear power station project , there is no doubt about china 's high-level and sophisticated experience in nuclear power technology .
taking china 's " hualong 1 " that will enter the british nuclear power market as scheduled as an example , it incorporates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and drew previous experience in design .
for instance , china has designed the " passive residual heat removal system at the secondary side of vapor generator " based on problems reflected in japan 's fukushima nuclear accident , which can remove the heat from reactor cores in time , avoiding the meltdown of reactor cores .
liu xiaoming said that china has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years , and international institutions set a high value on the achievements it has made in nuclear power development and regulatory .
it is now an important historic moment for the relationship between china and the uk , so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever .
the chinese side hoped that the uk government continues to support the hinkley point nuclear power station project , and makes a decision as early as possible to ensure the successful implementation of the project .
in the opinion of he weiwen , co-chair of the sino-america-europe economic strategy research center , the china association of international trade ( cait ) , since there is limited time for the british side to make the decision , the both parties need more substantive communications and dialogues .
" following the change of president of argentina , the china-argentina nuclear power station project was also laid aside temporarily , but it has now been clearly scheduled to begin construction in the first quarter of next year . "

today , the attention paid by people to tumors is increasing rapidly , which in a large part might be linked to cancer incidence at a high level in recent years .
according to reports about cancer in 2012 , there were about 3.37 million new cancer cases and some 2.11 million death cases in china every year .
cancer has been the no . 1 cause of death in china , with the death toll accounting for one quarter of the global death toll due to cancer .
due to its uncontrolled growth and proliferation , caner can affect nearly every part of human body .
generally speaking , any part of human body might suffer from cancer , and some kinds of cancers will also be transferred to other part of the body .
cancer is a genetic disease , but studies found that only a small number of cancers are genetic .
many factors can affect the occurrence and development of cancers , among which environmental factors are on top of the list and can be changed .
environmental factors include smoking , infectious factors , radiation , pollution as well as foods , nutrition , and physical activities , etc.
after mr. li was sent to the hospital , the doctor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyperosmolar coma caused by severe dehydration as a result of diarrhea , and he might die if sent here a few minutes later .
according to statistics , the symptom of diarrhea might be found in some 20 % of diabetics , particularly previously untreated patients or those whose blood glucose has not been controlled properly .
for some diabetics , chronic diarrhea might even the primary disease symptom , which is so deceptive and then leads to missed diagnosis and misdiagnose .
diarrhea in the wake of dyspepsia can lead to anorexia and nausea , and taking digestives can help the illness take a turn for a better way ; for bacterial diarrhea , the disease generally comes in suddenly and several times a day , accompanying with the feeling of abdominal pain , but it can get recovery after a short-term treatment .
and for diabetic diarrhea , it is mostly expressed in refractory diarrhea without obvious abdominal pain and with assayed excrements that do not accompany infection in most cases , but the number of diarrhea is significantly increased , up to 20-plus times a day .
additionally , when some hypoglycemic drugs such as melbine ( dmbg ) or α-glucosidase inhibitor are taken at very onset , patients might happen to side effects like abdominal distension , abdominal pain and diarrhea .
this is because stress hyperglycemia together with hypoglycemia condition might occur after diarrhea in case of inflammation .
moreover , human body is in a stress situation due to diarrhea , releasing multiple hormones . while its confrontation with diarrhea , human body will also suffer from much blood glucose that outflows , which might cause ketoacidosis in severe cases .
therefore , in addition to etiological treatment in hospital , diabetics should also pay attention to the following aspects after diarrhea .
diabetics suffering from acute diarrhea must prevent dehydration first , so it is necessary to drink more water , which naturally helps them with more urination , allowing for draining unnecessary blood glucose as well as acetone bodies .
however , it is best not to have drinks containing caffeine because caffeine can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and then aggravate diarrhea .
for diabetics , blood glucose regulation will be out of balance in case of acute diarrhea , so they must closely observe the changes of blood glucose . it is best to measure blood glucose every 3 to 4 hours .
the us food and drug administration ( fda ) recently approved field tests of genetically altered mosquitoes to be conducted in florida in the southeast of the united states .
this kind of genetically altered mosquito can help control the transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as zika , dengue fever and chikungunya fever .
according to a preliminary environmental assessment report released by the fda in march , this kind of mosquito will not significantly affect the environment .
the report also noted that , however , this did not mean this kind of mosquito can be used for commercial purpose .
oxitec also must follow other regulations specified by the federal , state and local governments , and work together with its local partner florida keys mosquito control district to determine the time of conducting field tests .
tests conducted in brazil , panama and cayman islands showed that this kind of mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in test areas by more than 90 % .

japanese pm abe will not visit war-dead shrine on ww2 anniversary : jiji
japanese prime minister shinzo abe will not visit a controversial shrine for war dead in tokyo on the anniversary of japan 's defeat in world war two defeat , jiji news agency has reported .
however , abe plans to send a ritual offering to the yasukuni shrine to mark the anniversary on monday , jiji reported on thursday .
the shrine honors 14 japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and is seen in china and south korea as a symbol of tokyo 's wartime militarism .
abe has not visited the shrine in person since december 2013 , which he said he did to show respect for those who died for their country .
japan 's new defense minister , tomomi inada , has declined to say whether she would visit the shrine because it was a matter of conscience .

the suspect had traveled from his home town near toulouse to saint-etienne-du-rouvray and spent the night there in the days before the attack , the source said .
the young man , who has no criminal record , has acknowledged having spent the night there but told investigators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with kermiche and petitjean , the source said .
investigators are trying to establish whether kermiche and petitjean had accomplices in france and whether they had links with islamic state , which has claimed responsibility for the attack .
a cousin of petitjean was also placed in preventive detention at the end of last month .
dorus de vries undergoes medical ahead of celtic move
nottingham forest goalkeeper dorus de vries has arrived in glasgow as he looks to complete a move to celtic .
de vries was pictured entering ross hall hospital ahead of a medical after the hoops agreed terms with the sky bet championship club .
parkhead boss brendan rodgers is on the look-out for an experienced stopper to challenge current number one craig gordon .
but rodgers has trust in 35-year-old de vries having worked with the dutchman during their spell together at swansea .
he made 51 appearances for the swans as they won promotion to the premier league under rodgers in 2011 .
he quit the welsh outfit that summer to join wolves and has been at the city ground since 2013 .
he also has experience of playing in scotland after spending a season with dunfermline after signing back in 2006 .
his east end park stay ended in disappointment , however , as the pars suffered the double agony of being relegated from the top-flight before losing out to celtic in the final of the scottish cup .
the keeper has just one year left on his forest contract and it has been reported celtic will only have to pay a nominal fee to land his signature .
during rio 2016 olympic games , security issue has been what people care about all the time , and people underwent another bomb fright before a men 's basketball game this morning .
the rio olympics organizing committee confirms that the police working together with the military have detonated a suspicious knapsack found in the basketball stadium under control before the basketball game between spain and nigeria kicked off .
a security guard told reuters that this suspicious knapsack was found after the end of the basketball game between brazil and croatia .
the police found the suspicious knapsack in a garbage can in a bathroom , according to the statement from a spokesman of the organizing committee .
afterwards , the knapsack was carried away by a robot which then detonated it under the guidance of the police and military .
the statement also mentioned , " there is a tablet , a pair of socks and a jacket in the knapsack . "
as the game between spain and nigeria kicked off , there were no spectators in the stadium , who were allowed to enter it after the security had been confirmed by the police .
the spain 's nba superstar pau gasol said that the players got confused about the then condition for a time , " we heard the explosion , but did not know what happened on earth .
at the beginning , we just heard the explosion and then looked around , but found everything was ok . "
there was also a suspicious bomb threat in the previous men 's road cycling race at the rio olympics , but fortunately , the bomb-disposal squad controlled and detonated a suspicious package near the finishing line .
in scorching and sweltering summer , an increasing number of skin problems will be found in infants , which is closely linked to sweating more .
temperature rise means the beginning of nightmare of many parents as their little baby starts suffering from itchy skin , accompanied with symptoms such as red rash and red spot , thus causing them to constantly scratch the skin and cry all the time at night .
tan xiaohua , a paediatrician from the third affiliated hospital of guangzhou medical university , observed that the proportion of little patients with skin diseases who seek for outpatient service will be increased every summer , and skin problems such as mosquito bites , eczema , reddish sudamen and diaper rash are more prominent .
in spite of various causes of formation , the symptoms are all much of a muchness , reflected in skin with red rashes and red spot as well as itchy skin .
as a matter of fact , the causes of these skin diseases are also quite similar , that is , little kids are not that " clean " due to too much sweat and saliva that but is not removed in time , so that the " covered " skin happens to diseases .
podiatrist tan xiaohua noted that little kids have much more delicate skin as well as more heat production and sweat than adults .
plus , the sweat gland of little kids is in the development , and the sweat gland and dermal gland of some children have not been balanced yet , leading to the inability to sweat .
" some parents have a good habit by carrying a small towel with them and immediately wiping away the sweat on their kid once found . "
" and for children often with wet clothes and sweat , skin rash will often be found on their body . "
if the summer is too hot , babies will sweat too much , so parents can increase showering frequency for them and then put dry clothes on them .
for example , a shower for babies is taken every day at ordinary times , and now it can be increased to twice a day . however , flushing is just ok in the second bath , without the use of any bath supplies .
in addition , to prevent skin diseases in summer , anti-miliaria potion containing some herb ingredients like honeysuckle can be dripped into the bath water for babies , which can help disperse pore and perspire .
the above are essentials for parents to protect their kid 's skin . for different skin diseases , parents can also adopt the following different treatment methods .
but keep in mind that if red rashes are accompanied with patches or repeatedly attack , it is recommended to see a doctor to check the possibility of other diseases .
" keep any students from being deprived of education due to family financial difficulties " is our party and government 's solemn promise .
the state places great emphasis on the efforts of funding the needy students by establishing a sound finance-aid system for college students covering multiple measures such as scholarship , loan , part-time jobs , allowance and tuition exemption
if students have questions , they can call the school in which they study first ; if it does n't work , they can dial the hotline set by relevant municipality or province and even the ministry of education .

it is estimated that fangshan district will still see a sustained rainfall and there will be geological disaster risks in mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas .
and according to the beijing warning center , an average precipitation measured by the rainfall monitoring stations across the city reached 20 mm , with 13.7 mm for urban area , from 6 : 00 am to 2 : 00 pm on august 12 .
it is learned that at the time of the steam pipe break accident , more than 20 persons were working on thermal energy debugging on site .
up to 3 : 30 am on the morning of august 12 , the wounded persons were still in the icu of dangyang people 's hospital for emergency treatment .
mr. feng , a family member of the wounded person luo wen , said that 90 % of his body has been scalded except hair and feet .
when mr. feng saw luo wen , he was unconscious due to serious injuries and doctors were saving his life .
it is understood that the five injured workers all suffer from scalding , some of whom are accompanied with injuries such as fracture .
upon receipt of the accident report , the state administration of work safety immediately dispatched a working group to rush to the scene of the accident , guiding and assisting local forces to make great efforts to carry out on-site rescue and accident handling .
major leaders of the cpc hubei provincial committee and the provincial government , together with leaders from the hubei provincial safety production supervision authority , also arrived on the scene to direct rescue operations after the accident .
according to the official , more than 17,700 people have been formally under arrest , over 11,500 people have been released , and more than 5,600 other people have been in custody .
it is learned that turkey 's rebel group attempted to launch a military coup on the evening of july 16 ( local time ) .
the turkish government accused the opposition faction missionary gulen of plotting an abortive coup attempt and requested the us to extradite him to turkey .
turkey 's justice minister bekir bozdag said later that his government has made a second request for extradition of gulen to the us .
from the evening of august 11 to the morning of august 12 , there were 2 explosions on phuket island , 1 in surat thani and 1 in the south of trang other than 4 in hua hin , agence france presse said .
it was previously reported that the first bomb exploded at local time 10 pm , august 11 , but no one was injured .
the explosion of the second bomb killed one thai woman and hurt several foreigners and thai people .
" among the wounded persons there are 3 seriously injured persons and 7 foreigners including 4 women and 3 men , " said local police .
after the accident , the thai police evacuated the public and visitors near the explosion sites and sent the wounded persons to local hospitals .
at present , the thai police are investigating the motivation behind the explosion cases and what kind of bomb has been used .
as a renowned seashore tourism city in prachuap khiri khan province , thailand , hua hin attracts tons of domestic and foreign visitors every year .
located about 200 kilometers away from the south of bangkok , the city is a summer resort for the thai royal household , where there are a number of beautiful beaches , national parks , historic sites and ruins of royal household .
on august 12 , the world health organization ( who ) said that the risk for visitors , who go to brazil to watch the 2016 rio olympic games and rio paralympic games , to suffer from zika virus infection or transmission is not high .
if athletes and travelers have to go to brazil , preventive measures can be taken to avoid two ways of zika virus transmission : mosquito bites and sexual transmission .
as of august 10 , 66 countries and regions have reported the evidence of the mosquito-borne zika virus transmission since 2015 .
some countries or regions reported the decreased number of zika virus infection cases , but the outbreak of zika has not shown a declining trend in general according to the evidences obtained at the present stage .
the who stated that although there have been zika virus cases imported from overseas to the chinese mainland , no local cases of human infected by mosquitoes have been found .
on august 12 , philippine president rodrigo duterte said that although he abused philip goldberg , u.s. ambassador to the philippines , he would not make an apology to goldberg .
on august 12 , the u.s. embassy in the philippines said in a statement that the us side has noticed the reports about the criticism on goldberg and these remarks were " inappropriate and unacceptable " .
during the election campaign of president of the philippines this april , goldberg criticized duterte on the issue of human rights , and the two continued to accuse each other with sharp speech conflicts later on .
on august 12 beijing time , the spanish men 's basketball team saw a glimmer of hope of reaching the next phase after a tough 96-87 victory over nigeria .
oguchi got 24 points , including 7 of 12 three-pointers and all the 3 free throws made but no scores from the field , akognon contributed 12 points and 5 rebounds , and ibekwe scored 11 points and 5 rebounds .
as a traditional european team , spain was severely weakened by the absence of its star player marc gasol , which had it on the ropes and even made it hard to advance from the group .
facing the weakest competitor nigeria in the group , spain also played very hard and scraped through the game at the eleventh hour .
within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quarter , nigeria failed to score again , and rodriguez hit a three-pointer to help spain take a 25-11 lead into the first-quarter break after 5 straight points .
when there were 3 ' 54" to go in the second quarter , gasol made a driving layup to help spain hold the lead at 40-27 .
when there were 6 ' 09" left in this quarter , llull hit two free throws for a 61-48 spain lead , a two-digit advantage once again .
after oguchi 's three-pointer for nigeria , spain scored 4 straight points to extend its lead to 14 .
however , within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quarter , spain stopped scoring . on the contrary , nigeria ended this quarter with a wave of 13-0 including points in the paint and outside shots for a 66-65 lead , the first in the whole game .
in this wave of attacks , nigeria hit two three-pointers and a foul outside the three-pointer line .
when the game came to the last 3 ' 49" , nigeria closed to 79-81 after aminu added a layup .
after oguchi 's another three-pointer helped nigeria reduce the score disparity to 1 , reyes and gasol who scored 6 straight points with free throws gave spain an 89-82 lead as there were 1 ' 15" to go .
on the evening of august 12 beijing time , beijing guoan lost 1-2 to chongqing lifan at home in the 22nd round of the chinese super league .
after a short-term adjustment courtside , yu dabao returned to the pitch , but his trouble has n't been cleared up . so , he was substituted by song boxuan in the 76th minute due to his inability to hold on later in the game .
what is more , yu dabao could not move by himself and was stretchered off . after a 10-minute treatment courtside , he was directly sent into an emergency ambulance .
as far as the " national football squad " is concerned , the possible injury of yu dabao will certainly affect china 's competition for the russia 2018 asian qualifiers that will kick off half a month later .
in a postponed chinese super league game held in this midweek , in which guoan was held to a 0-0 draw by evergrande away from home , yu dabao 's neck has been injured after a fierce fight for a ball against josé paulo bezerra maciel júnior , both of whom fell over at that time .
also in that game , yu hanchao 's serious injury made people more anxious . according to a conservative estimation , he needs a four-month recovery period , that is , he will at least miss the first half of the games for the top 12 chinese football teams .
if yu dabao 's injury is serious , the front-field staffing of china 's national football squad will be greatly affected .
however , engineers from university of california , berkeley , have advanced this concept and developed a tiny wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body .
the researchers introduced their invention on the neuron published on august 3 .
on top of that , these battery-free sensors can be used to stimulate nerve and muscle .
this will probably offer a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate human immune system .
this device has been implanted into the muscle and peripheral nerve of rats , and uses ultrasound as energy source , which is also used to read collected data .
this sensor has been compressed to 1 mm3 , called " neural dust " which includes a piezo-electric crystal .
the author of this paper explained that the crystal converts the vibration of ultrasound emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor , which is directly attached to a nerve or muscle fibers , inside the device .
voltage peak in fibers causes changes of current circuit and crystal vibration , so that ultrasonic receiver ( which currently is still the source that sends ultrasonic vibration ) can detect echo .
now that ultrasonic technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasonic vibration can penetrate most parts of human body , it seems to be a natural choice .
michael maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at university of california , berkeley .
as the co-corresponding author of the paper , he said in a statement , " i believe that the long-term prospect of neural dust is not restricted to nerve and brain , but much broader . "
maharbiz , together with his colleagues and jose carmena , a neuroscientist at university of california , berkeley , led the research .
" it was utterly impossible to adopt internal telemetry technology in the past , because a tiny object cannot be put into a very deep place , " explained he .
" now , however , i can take a tiny object and put it near nerve , organ , digestive tract or muscle , which then can read data . "
to test their device , maharbiz and caarmena utilized six 540ns ultrasonic pulse sent per 100ms to drive sensor .
but the researchers feel quite confident that they can also work in the brain and central nervous system .
" the neural dust project is created with a vision of describing next generation brain-machine exchange and interaction and making it a feasible clinic technology . "
" if a paralyzed patient hopes to control a computer or a robot arm , you can implant this electrode into his / her brain , where it can continuously work for a lifetime . "
since the two lenses work simultaneously , they can distinguish obvious front and rear landscapes , producing a more shallow depth of field .
in the wake of kumamoto earthquake , not only local japanese territory was damaged , but the world 's core industrial chain of digital cameras was also broken .
following the kumamoto earthquake , sony 's plant in japan suffered from heavy losses , causing the world 's digital camera industry to be now in a situation of either short supply or rise in price .
almost all the sensors developed by sony are used for cameras . the absence of sensor supply means no cameras to be produced .
recently there was news that sony has currently raised approximately us $ 3.6 billion in the form of issuance of stocks and bonds for the r & d and production of stack cmos .
the supply of sensors is nearly made possible by sony , regardless of digital cameras or mobile intelligent devices ( i ca n't image what would the scientific academia looks like if there was no sony ) .
compared to sources about new recording format revealed , i would rather prefer to see sony can recover its normal supply of sensors , because today 's camera prices are extremely high .
macy 's to close 100 stores
department store giant macy 's said on thursday that it plans to close 100 stores , a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem : america , it says , has too many stores for the online shopping era .
macy 's regularly prunes its store portfolio , often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush .
but in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations , the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment .
pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a macy 's store in new york .
the retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores .
macy 's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change : many of its stores are located in small , regional malls , the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce .
and the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as t . j . maxx and fast-fashion players such as h & m to buy their clothes .
these factors , along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather , have left macy 's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year .
on thursday , the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter , a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter .
the retailer 's revenue was $ us5.87 billion ( $ a7.64 billion ) , down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year .
macy 's said the store closures would probably cost it about $ us1 billion in annual sales .
and at one time , such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer 's concession of defeat .
yet the company 's stock soared 17 per cent on thursday , a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for macy 's .
in some ways , it should not come as a surprise that macy 's is slashing stores .
terry lundgren , the retailer 's chief executive , has said before that the chain simply had too many stores .
executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores , trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations .
jeff gennette , the macy 's executive who has been appointed to replace lundgren in 2017 , said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding .
" we recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the macy 's brand , " gennette said .
the company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date .
macy 's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter , and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed .
the retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores , but will look to close stores that are in weak locations .
the move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators , who count on big tenants like macy 's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres .
is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria ?
according to new research , drinking from refillable water bottle can be " many times worse than licking your dog 's toy " in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with .
the website treadmill reviews commissioned emlab p & k to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top , slide-top , squeeze-top , and straw-top .
each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed .
your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy .
" based on the 12 water bottles we tested , we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells : more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter ( cfu / sq cm ) , " treadmill reviews said .
slide-top were found to have the highest germ content , with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre ( cfu / sq ) cm on average .
the bottles harboured gram-positive cocci , which can lead to skin infections , pneumonia , or blood poisoning .
squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 cfu / sq cm , and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 cfu / sq cm .
" drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet 's dish , " the site added .
a far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles , which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 cfu / sq cm .
this may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs .
the germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as " mostly harmless . "
" based on our test results , we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle , both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs , " the site said .
we also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria , stainless steel is a better choice than plastic .
additionally , water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs .
the site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use , ideally with a weak bleach solution .
religion must either modernise or face obsolescence
in the united states the democratic party recently nominated hillary clinton as its presidential candidate .
if the results of the latest polls hold true at election time , america will swear in its first female president in january .
the previous week , across the pond , british prime minister theresa may was negotiating the terms of britain 's exit from europe with germany 's chancellor angela merkel .
women living in western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education , ambition and hard work .
and young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership .
so is the long and hard battle for women 's equality finally over ?
hillary clinton is poised to become president of the united states , but in the religious sphere women 's leadership is still a contentious issue .
well , not entirely .
in the religious sphere women 's leadership remains a contentious issue .
last week pope francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the catholic church .
the anglican church consecrated libby lane as its first female bishop in january 2015 , but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012 .
while the jewish reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s , and the conservative movement since the early 1980s , in orthodox judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested .
in november 2015 , the orthodox rabbinical council of america - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for orthodox women 's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis .
not without irony , as hillary clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading american orthodox rabbis opposed to women 's ordination launched a series of " hearings " on this disputed subject .
why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred ?
orthodox judaism , like most religions , seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values .
this finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society .
those who oppose women 's ordination do so on the basis that it is not " traditional . "
but the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost .
and the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant .
in the guns of august , a military history of the first world war , barbara tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the " tragedy of the red trousers . "
in the lead up to wwi , as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance , it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible .
the british and german armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns .
the french soldiers , however , still wore the same red caps and trousers , marking them out as easy targets .
the suggestion of the french war minister adolphe messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance .
the red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up .
at a parliamentary hearing , a former war minister , eugene etienne , spoke for france .
" eliminate the red trousers ? " he cried .
never !
" that blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours , " wrote messimy afterwards , " was to have cruel consequences . "
faith leaders grappling with women 's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall .
by focusing exclusively on " what is traditional " for their religion rather than asking the crucial question : " what change is necessary for religion to thrive ? " they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock .
they also deprive the entire community of the talent , skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute .
insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional , but , as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates , it may not be worth the price .

charlton athletic fan ' can only get season ticket if he signs behavioural contract ' and agrees not to badmouth club on social media
whilst we recognise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion , it is not helpful when inflammatory comments are posted on such websites .
the fan , who works in administration , was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police chief inspector cliff eager , who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force .
the letter continued : " i need to advise you that the granting of your season ticket will be ' conditioned ' and subject to you signing an ' agreed behavioural contract ' ( abc ) which will request that you refrain from posting derogatory or inflammatory comments regarding the club or people representing the club in the future on any social media websites , or carrying out any other form of behaviour that could be deemed to be on an anti-social nature . "
speaking to the daily telegraph , the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket , which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post .
yesterday , he went to the meeting with the club and said : " they told me i had been tweeting excessively and causing other people to tweet as well - which is ridiculous . '
a cycling holiday down the dalmatian coast
what do you mean , luxury ?
i rode my butt off back there , " says colleen , a former us naval commander who has just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the spine of some rugged croatian island and left nothing out there but a bucketful of sweat and a salvo of salty naval expletives hurled at the hostile hills .
some cyclists sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes as a climbing aid .
colleen 's friend patty recommends the little engine that could .
others count revolutions or just suffer in silence , wondering what it takes to enter the trance-like state of which hardened cyclists speak .
colleen swears , with more venom than variety .
cycling a few yards ahead of her is like being pursued by hugh grant in the opening sequence of four weddings and a funeral .
her mission and mine is a week-long " luxury " boat and bike tour of croatia 's north dalmatian coast and islands , organised by freedom treks .
cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as croatia might not fit everyone 's idea of luxury , but north dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south , our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike .
the luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week , the brand new melody .
at the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides ivan and ivana to stow , and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins , sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that croatians call a beach .
in late june the sea is a perfect temperature , all agree : cool enough to refresh , but not cold .
the melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle .
instead , most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where helena , the ship 's masseuse - i 'm not joking - will have made our beds , restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table .
ivan says stretching is important after cycling , and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails .
the melody , at 42 m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates , is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser .
she turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts , and we are proud to belong to her .
colleen and patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from washington dc : the over 45 sport and socials , they call themselves .
last year 's barge and bike holiday in the netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in croatia .
a rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in provence , and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive facebook postings .
the adventure element of the holiday can be overstated , because our schedule is nothing if not regimented .
" breakfast and dinner are at eight o ' clock , " ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of trogir , near split .
one ring of the ship 's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing .
" good moaning ! " is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the british contingent .
who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast , while ivana hands out sketch maps of the day 's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles , contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it , although anything else would be a surprise on a croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level .
" it 's like a heart monitor , " says ivan .
completely flat is not recommended .
ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text , switching fluently between english and german .
some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with , but we are an easy group - swiss , german , american and british - which divides easily at mealtimes into two english speaking tables , one german .
on the road we are all friends .
cycling breeds camaraderie , and the only competition is with the terrain , which is to say ourselves .
i ca n't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic .
we soon tune in to ivan 's wave length .
a stiff climb is an incline , not to be confused with an undulation , which is a good thing .
hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on : simple but not always easy .
cycling instructions are always the same : " single file , keep your distance , and it 's not a race .
we meet on the quay at nine .
ok , five past - you 're on holiday , i forgot .
take lots of water .
from trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the kornati archipelago , where we ride most of the length of dugi otok - croatian for " long island " - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the telašćica nature park , to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel .
it is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it .
if we paddle , will our legs feel younger and stronger ?
at the small island of molat we turn south again , hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion .
most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg : olive groves , vineyards , prickly herbal scrub ; mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing .
while we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when ivan calls a halt , and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals .
the sport and socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette , sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely .
" you were nearly a hood ornament there , " one cyclist tells another , after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard .
fortunately they worked .
ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads , with ivana at the very back to encourage and " scoop up , " as ivan puts it .
and if a main road must be crossed we all assemble , dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side , as instructed and not before .
" do you think ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children ? " a swiss cyclist asks , as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross .
our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness .
a city tour at zadar reveals remains of a roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster , through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water .
zadar 's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding , and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor , in fact .
when melody sets sail for the lively resort of biograd in the early morning , the organ 's song is no more than a whisper .
day five is entirely free of cycling .
a boat trip up the krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls ; an afternoon tour of sibenik with its domed cathedral , a masterpiece of the dalmatian renaissance ; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of zlarin in search of its local speciality , coral - make for an interesting day .
lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks
people gather during the annual catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of notre dame de lourdes .
french security forces are on high alert as thousands of catholics converge on the shrine of lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks .
each year , tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the pyrenees for the feast of the assumption on august 15 , marking the ascent of the virgin mary into heaven .
this year 's pilgrimage comes as catholics reel from the killing of an elderly french priest on july 26 by two islamist extremists , who stormed his church in northern france during mass and slit his throat .
jacques hamel 's murder came under two weeks after a tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a bastille day crowd in the riviera city of nice , killing 85 people .
many in france are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months .
with tourist arrivals in the country plummeting , authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year 's pilgrimage would be sharply down .
but fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge .
around 25,000 faithful are expected , including mass groups from italy and belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the eastern orthodox branch of christianity .
many pilgrims say they will not be cowed .
" we 're not going to stop living , " christian , a 66-year-old visitor , told afp , describing prayer as the " only weapon " in the face of violence .
" it 's important to show that life goes on , " said matthieu guignard , one of the coordinators .
it 's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith , our beliefs , our way of living .
several major events have been cancelled in france since the nice attack over security concerns , including a huge flea market in the northern city of lille and the european road cycling championships that had been set to take place in nice in september .
" for the past week , my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations , " fabien lejeusne , the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend .
instead , the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful , he said , reporting a last-minute bookings spurt .
the head of the local hotel workers ' union , christian gelis , confirmed signs of " increased interest " in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks .
security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine , where the virgin mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to bernadette soubirous , a poor shepherd girl , in 1858 .
around 250 police and two dozen soldiers , including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs , have been deployed to protect the area .
pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site , where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three .
catherine simcox , who made a pilgrimage from the north east of england to lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security .
" by thursday morning , there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry ( with metal barriers ) with bags being searched on the way in , " she told the local .
" this total freaked my three kids out who are used to lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening , " she said .
it did n't spoil my experience , but it saddened me that it was necessary and i understood that some people were reassured by the measures .
the route of friday 's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary , it will start and end at the shrine .
other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above lourdes to flights , closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags .
interior minister bernard cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on saturday .
lourdes attracts around six million people a year , making it one of the biggest sites of catholic pilgrimage in the world .
many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives , who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where bernadette said she saw mary , believing the water to have healing properties .
thierry castillo , another of the organisers , described this year 's gathering as " a bit unusual " given " the threat that seems to have taken root in france . "
but " it wo n't affect the quality and depth of what they experience , " he assured .
francoise , a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims , admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues " a little overwhelming . "
but if it reassures everyone , it 's good .

turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt
turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to turkey in a recall of personnel following a july 15 coup attempt .
foreign minister mevut cavusoglu said friday that 208 members of turkey 's ministry staff were recalled to ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt , and 32 remain missing " without permission . "
about 18,000 civil servants , military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in turkey , the government believing their loyalties lie with u . s . - based cleric fethullah gulen , whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government .
gulen , who lives in pennsylvania , is on turkey 's most-wanted list .
cavosoglu said a u.s. department of justice team will visit turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition .
the issue has become a problem for the united states in its dealings with turkey , a nato member .
the united states has objected to the strong-arm tactics of turkish president recep tayyip erdogan following the coup , and turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with russia .
cavosoglu said two turkish military attaches in greece fled to italy , an attaché in kuwait attempted to escape to saudi arabia but was sent back and two generals in afghanistan were caught in dubai and sent to turkey .
he added two civil servants in bangladesh fled to new york , and one in russia went to japan .
the ankara newspaper daily hurryiet , citing military sources , added turkey 's military attaché in jordan was also missing .
the wall street journal , citing a u.s. official familiar with the situation , reported that a turkish military officer stationed at a virginia nato command center requested asylum in the united states .
there are those who have escaped .
there have been escapees among our diplomats as well , " cavosoglu told broadcaster ntv in an interview .
as of yesterday , time has run out for those initially called back .
we will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned .
olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool
olympic divers planning to practice friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the rio games .
the water suddenly changed color tuesday , midway through the synchronized diving events .
officials insisted the water was safe for competing , even after a larger , adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green .
the diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups , though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1 / 2 hours before the start of the women 's 3-meter event .
the water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green .
american diver abby johnston , who is competing on the springboard , said she showed up for her warmup , only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice .
she wrote on twitter that " # fixtheswamp " should start trending .
british diver tom daley , who won bronze in the synchro platform event , also commented on the state of the pool in a twitter post .
hopefully that means we have n't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days !
mario andrada , chief spokesman for the local organizing committee , stressed that the pool was safe for competition , clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries .
he conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water , but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool .
" we reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes , " he said .
in the first day of this water situation , one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy .
this was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools .
we reduced immediately the quantity .
we retested the water and it was totally within the parameters .
simon langford , chief spokesman for the maria lenk aquatics center , said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning .
he said the decision was supported by world governing body fina .
" the reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible , " langford said in a statement .
andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool 's deteriorating condition .
" chemistry is not an exact science , " he said .
some things , as you can see , went longer than expected .
rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal .
" the rain does n't help , " andrada said .
he added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning , but conceded that " was not ideal . "
he explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels , much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly .
when we went to fix the green , there was a discussion about the best chemicals .
we ca n't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it , " andrada said .
we certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green .
once it turned green , we again made another bit of a mistake .

the forum has been held by the two cities in rotation since 2010 .

ugandan president meets chinese fm , anticipates closer cooperation
ugandan president yoweri museveni on thursday thanked china for its long-term support for uganda 's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting chinese foreign minister wang yi .
china is an old friend of uganda and africa , who has sided with africa during the continent 's liberation from colonialism and later supported africa 's economic and social development , museveni said .
the president cited the tanzania-zambia railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of china 's generous support even when china was by then not so prosperous itself .
china has carried out multifaceted cooperation with uganda , ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges , museveni said , adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to uganda 's long-term development than simply providing aids .
he hopes china can , through various ways , join in uganda 's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks .
he also welcomes more chinese to invest and travel in uganda .
wang yi hailed the progress uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization , adding that china will continue to play the role of uganda 's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner .
china stands ready to try its best in helping uganda pursue economic and social development , wang said , noting that sino-ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship .
he said china would strengthen its cooperation with uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks , and support the east african nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors .
